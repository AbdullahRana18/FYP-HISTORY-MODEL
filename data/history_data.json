          "answer": "Marathas were the militant Hindu community concentrated mainly in the southern\nIndian state of Mahrashtra. The Maratha Empire was founded by the ferocious Marathan\ncommander Shivaji in the 1670s. They gradually organized themselves and began to offer\nstiff resistance to the Mughals. They defeated the Mughal army in 1737 outside Delhi and\nhad captured the strategic town of Malwa in 1738. During the first six decades of the 18th\ncentury, they were the most powerful and established community in India that was ready to\nfill in the power vacuum created by the declining Mughal rule. Successive Mughal rulers found\nit almost impossible to check the rapidly growing Marathan power. Aurangzeb spent about\n25 years in the Deccan desperately trying to eliminate the Marathas. On his return, he found\nthe state treasury almost empty and this added to his difficulties.\nHowever, the mighty Mughal rule did not decline due to the Maratha factor alone.\nHistorians also blame the prejudiced and intolerant policies of Aurangzeb, who adopted strict\nmeasures against the non-Muslims. He imposed the discriminatory Islamic tax Jiziya on the\nnon-Muslims that had earlier been abolished by Akbar, though he tried to defend himself by\nwaiving some other taxes. He also demolished a number of Hindu temples, and adopted a\nharsh attitude towards the Sikhs. Being a staunch Sunni ruler, he banned many activities\nsuch as painting, music, drinking, gambling and dance that had been part of the Indian culture\nand society. He also tried to ban the Hindu custom of Suttee, burning widow alive on the\ncremation of her husband. In order to meet huge expenses of military campaigns, he imposed\nheavy taxes, and the money collected by taxes was spent on luxurious buildings, a tradition\nof the Mughal rulers. All this made Aurangzeb very unpopular, and his successors found it\nquite difficult to rule the empire.\nWeak successors of Aurangzeb fell victim to extravagant and luxurious lifestyles and\npaid little attention to the defence and consolidation of the empire. They became morally\ncorrupt and comfort-loving, and could not overcome the difficulties faced by various parts of\nthe huge empire. This complacence is the usual result of continued successes of major\nempires, and the Mughals were no exception to this. Negligence of the weak later Mughals\nto the state affairs also contributed to the fall of the Mughal Empire.\nThe Mughals did not have a definite law of succession. On the death of an emperor,\nthe princes got engaged in conspiracies, intrigues and making loyal groups that always led\nto regicidal wars of succession. Success of a candidate often depended on the support he\ncould get from the military and ministers. Thus, state resources were wasted on mutual fights\ninstead of public welfare and defence of the empire.\nAurangzeb had divided the whole empire between his three sons in order to prevent\na war of succession. However, the three princes began to fight, and eventually, Prince\nMuazzam established himself as Emperor. Only after a few years, his four sons fought over\nthe throne, but the victor, Jahandar Shah was murdered within a year. So, in the ten years\nafter Aurangzeb’s death, twelve different people claimed to be Emperor at one time. This\ngreatly destabilized the huge Mughal Empire.\nFinally, the last nail in the coffin of the Mughal rule was perhaps driven by the British,\nwho began to dominate the political horizon of India, 1750 onwards. The tottering Mughal\nEmpire was no match to the British supremacy in warfare. The British very skillfully\nestablished themselves in India and eventually replaced the Mughals by annexing all\nimportant states between 1757 and 1856. They started their victorious journey from north-\neastern India, and moving southwards, they turned to the north-western territories of Sindh,\nPunjab and Kashmir. They also successfully applied their famous strategy of “divide and\nrule” to occupy the Indian subcontinent.\n\n\nTo conclude, we can say that the power of the Marathas was the decisive factor in\nthe decline of the Mughals because, if the Mughals had won their support, they might have\njointly averted the process of decline, or at least slowed it down. Instead, Mughals failed to\nmake friends with them and constantly earned their hostility.",

All this made Aurangzeb very unpopular, and his successors found it\nquite difficult to rule the empire.\nWeak successors of Aurangzeb fell victim to extravagant and luxurious lifestyles and\npaid little attention to the defence and consolidation of the empire. They became morally\ncorrupt and comfort-loving, and could not overcome the difficulties faced by various parts of\nthe huge empire. This complacence is the usual result of continued successes of major\nempires, and the Mughals were no exception to this. Negligence of the weak later Mughals\nto the state affairs also contributed to the fall of the Mughal Empire.\nThe Mughals did not have a definite law of succession. On the death of an emperor,\nthe princes got engaged in conspiracies, intrigues and making loyal groups that always led\nto regicidal wars of succession. Success of a candidate often depended on the support he\ncould get from the military and ministers. Thus, state resources were wasted on mutual fights\ninstead of public welfare and defence of the empire.\nAurangzeb had divided the whole empire between his three sons in order to prevent\na war of succession. However, the three princes began to fight, and eventually, Prince\nMuazzam established himself as Emperor. Only after a few years, his four sons fought over\nthe throne, but the victor, Jahandar Shah was murdered within a year. So, in the ten years\nafter Aurangzeb’s death, twelve different people claimed to be Emperor at one time. This\ngreatly destabilized the huge Mughal Empire.\nFinally, the last nail in the coffin of the Mughal rule was perhaps driven by the British,\nwho began to dominate the political horizon of India, 1750 onwards. The tottering Mughal\nEmpire was no match to the British supremacy in warfare. The British very skillfully\nestablished themselves in India and eventually replaced the Mughals by annexing all\nimportant states between 1757 and 1856. They started their victorious journey from north-\neastern India, and moving southwards, they turned to the north-western territories of Sindh,\nPunjab and Kashmir. They also successfully applied their famous strategy of “divide and\nrule” to occupy the Indian subcontinent.\n\n\nTo conclude, we can say that the power of the Marathas was the decisive factor in\nthe decline of the Mughals because, if the Mughals had won their support, they might have\njointly averted the process of decline, or at least slowed it down. Instead, Mughals failed to\nmake friends with them and constantly earned their hostility.\nQ. Was British expansion in India the most important reason for the decline\nof the Mughal Empire? Explain your answer. (14)\nAns.\nThe British East India Company (EIC) reached India in 1600 AD when the Mughal\nEmpire was nearing its peak. The British had primarily come for trade in India. Initially, their\ntrade benefited Indians, too, but gradually the British began to enjoy monopoly on trade. With\ntime, the money thus earned was used to manufacture more sophisticated weapons. Being\nthe first beneficiary of the Industrial Revolution, they had more ..."

          "answer": "British expanded their influence in India quite skillfully between 1750 and 1850. They\ngained strength primarily due to the major victories like the battles of Plassey (1757) and\nBuxar (1764) in Bengal, and the Anglo-Mysore wars. They utilized every possible way to win\nthe battles. They bribed Mir Jaffar of Nawab Siraj ud Daula, and Mir Sadiq of Tipu Sultan to\ngain victories in northern and southern India. Finally, they captured Sindh, the Punjab and\nKashmir from 1843 to1849. These victories gave them huge and rich areas to rule and to\nexploit local resources to strengthen their position. They built railways to facilitate movement\nof soldiers more quickly and easily to various parts of India. With this trade also began to\nflourish making them richer and stonger.\nWhile getting control of the conquered states the EIC began to enforce British system\nof administration. This comprised the system of judiciary and governors and the Governor\nGeneral. The early Governor-Generals tried to win the Indian confidence by various steps.\nUnder the Charter Act 1833, the Indians were gradually included in the Civil Services. Thus,\na team of obedient Indians was gradually prepared. This helped the EIC to run the state\naffairs along the British lines. The EIC also introduced trade laws that favoured its imports\nand exports as well as local trade. The revenue collected from India was cleverly spent by\nthe British to buy and ship the local goods to England.\nBritish also had superior military skills and more advanced weapons to which Indian\nArmy was no match. British were the most important beneficiary of the Industrial Revolution\nas they began to develop highly advanced weapons. Their gun powder weapons were much\nmore destructive than the orthodox arsenal of India. The Indians did not develop a modern\nnavy agains the British. Their disunity was closely observed and exploited by the British who\nkept them divided by such tactics as the subsidiary alliances introduced by Lord Wellesley in\n1798. This enabled them to win the support of several smaller states of India. This way they\nutilized their famous ‘divide and rule policy’ to strengthen their control over India.",

          "question": "Why did British government take control from the EIC? [7]",
          "answer": "British government wanted to make India its colony. It knew that political affairs of the\nIndian Sub-Continent could no longer be run by a trading company. In a way it was becoming\na matter of prestige for the British government. Therefore, by passing a series of acts, the\npowers of the EIC were gradually restricted. Under the Regulating Act of 1773, the EIC was\nmade accountable to the British Parliament. A Governor General, Warren Hastings, was\nappointed for the province of Bengal.\nThere were also reports of mismanagement and corruption by the EIC officials, in\nBengal and other provinces. The Company officials forced the newly appointed Nawab of\n\n\nBengal to give heavy bribe to them in the form of gifts. They were involved in financial\nembezzlement of the revenue of the states they had annexed. This was damaging the repute\nof the British government. In 1784, the British Government passed the India Act and took\ndirect control of the Indian possessions. It appointed a Governor General who would have\ncontrol of the three presidencies: Bengal, Bombay and Madras. New posts of Commander-\nin-Chief of the armed forces, and provincial governor were created. So, in 1813, the EIC lost\nits monopoly, though it continued to trade in India. Other British companies also wanted to\nshare in the profits of India.\nBritish also wanted to deploy a regular army on the north-western border to counter\nthe Russian threat. Russia had been desperately looking for access to the warm water sea.\nBy way of Afghanistan, it could invade India to reach the ports of the Indian Ocean as\nAfghanistan had been used by several earlier invaders as a springboard to attack India.\nTherefore, in order to keep Russia from any such adventure the British government had to\ntake control from the EIC.",

          "question": "Was the India Act of 1784 the main reason why the British were able\nto expand beyond Bengal between 1784 and 1850? [10/14]",
          "answer": "The British government took many steps to restructure the EIC.In 1784, the India Act,\nalso known as the Pitt’s India Act, was passed by the Prime Minister William Pitt. The Act\nempowered the British government to take direct control of Indian possessions. Under this\nthe Governor General was made a royal appointment, and the Company’s Board of Directors\nwas replaced by a Board of Control comprising six members including the Secretary of State\nand the Chancellor of Exchequer. Lord Cornwallis was thus appointed as the Governor\nGeneral in 1786 to rule the three presidencies of Calcutta/Kolkatta, Bombay/Mumbai and\nMadras/Chennai. He was assisted by three governors, and a Commander-in-Chief of the\narmed forces. The status of the EIC thus changed from a trading concern to a sovereign body\nin which the Crown (British government) directly controlled Bengal. Moreover, a police system\nwas introduced that would help in the administration of justice and maintaining law and order\nin India.This way the powers of the EIC were cleverly restricted while preparing the ground\nfor the British government ruling India directly. The British took many other measures to\nstrengthen its grip on India in later years. Lord Cornwallis enforced the Permanent Settlement\nAct in 1793. The Act made the Zamindars of Bengal landowners on the condition of paying a\nfixed amount of tax to the British. In 1793 the amount of this tax was 10% of the amount\ncollected from the Zamindars. Hence, the Permanent Settlement secured the financial\ninterests of the East India Company and helped Bengal to become the richest province of\nIndia enabling the British to expand their influence beyond Bengal.\nLord Wellesley became Governor General in 1798 and he introduced the system of subsidiary\nalliances. Under this the local rulers were persuaded to accept the British defence and pay\nits costs in the form of salaries for the British soldiers. In return, they were allowed to retain\ntheir rulership while enhancing the British rule surreptitiously as they had to accept a British\nresident advisor. They could not employ any European in their service without approval of\nthe British, nor could they negotiate with any other Indian rulers without consulting the\nGovernor General. The Nizam of Hyderabad became the first victim of this policy. In 1798,\n\n\nthe Nizam was detached from the French and was also barred from making any alliance with\nthe Marathas. In 1799, Tipu Sultan was defeated and killed, and the state of Mysore was\nannexed by Lord Wellesley.\nThe Nawab of Oudh was forced to accept this policy in 1801, and the Maratha Peshwa\nBaji Rao-II also subjugated his stats in 1802. Other Maratha states like Bhosle, Sindia and\nfinally, the Maratha Confederation, Holkars also surrendered in 1803. The Marathas were\ndecisively defeated in the third Anglo-Maratha War, 1817-1818. The British army occupied\nDelhi in 1803, and shifted the Royal Mughal Family from Red Fort to Qutub Saheb. This way,\nseveral states came under the British rule in a slow and clever way.\nThe British finally turned towards north-western India. In order to undo the damage to their\nprestige by their defeat in Afghanistan in 1841, the British provoked the Amirs of Sindh who\nattacked the British resident Charles Napier. The British retaliated with full force and annexed\nSindh in 1843. The Punjab was annexed by exploiting the chaos in the Sikh Darbar/Court\nfollowing the death of its strong ruler, Maharaja Ranjeet Singh. The ambitious rival chiefs\nattacked the British possessions south of the River Sutlej, giving British an excuse to invade\nthe Punjab. After the Treaty of Lahore of 1846, the British, helped by a Hindu chief Gulab\nSingh Dogra, annexed Kashmir that was given to Gulab Singh as a reward. Finally, the\nPunjab and the NWF were annexed fully on 30th March 1849.\nThe Pitt’s India Act seems to be the decisive factor in the British expansion in India\nbecause it laid down a strong foundation on which was erected the building of all future\nvictories of the British. The Act gave the British a sense of success as they began to exploit\nthe Indian weaknesses including their inherent disunity.",

          "answer": "Robert Clive was a gifted military commander in the EIC. First he defeated the French,\nand then strengthened the British control over India during the second half of the eighteenth\ncentury. In 1751, he defeated the Nawab of Carnatak, Chanda Sahib in the battle of Arcot,\npart of the second Carnatak war. The Nawab was assisted by a small number of French\ntroops. This increased the influence of the British in southern India. The EIC slowly began to\nexpand its control over northern India with the help of Clive.\nClive became more prominent by winning one of the most important battles, the battle\nof Plassey against Nawab Siraj ud Daula of Bengal, in 1757. This victory was a result of the\nclever war tactics of Clive as well as his ability to bribe the key officer of the Nawab, Mir Jafar.\nThus, the British gained control of one of the richest provinces of India, and also began a\nhighly profitable trade in Bengal.\nClive’s repute further improved by his role in the decisive battle of Buxar, in 1764. The\ncombined armies of the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II, the Nawab of Bengal Mir Qasim, and\nthe Nawab of Oudh could not defend themselves against a smarter British army led by Robert\nClive and Hector Monro. With this victory the entire province of Bengal and neighbouring\nterritories came under the British rule. The EIC now took control of the revenue collection in\nBengal, Bihar and Orissa, and also extended influence to Oudh. It decided to give some\nreward to Robert Clive for these important victories.

          "answer": "Warren Hastings was a very studious employee of the East India Company and\ngained success and prominence in the Company. Though unsupported, and at times,\nopposed by his colleagues, he worked very hard to raise revenue of the Company.\nIn order to achieve his objectives, he introduced the concept of putting the tax\ncollectors up for auction. This tempted many to acquire the post by paying heavy\nmoney to the Company.\nOnce the ambitious candidates got the desired position of tax collector, they would\nuse all tactics to extort taxes from the Indians. They would force even the poor farmers\nto pay the fixed taxes regardless of the land produce affected by drought or other\ncalamities.\nHastings also extended the British control over central and southern India by fighting\nand defeating fierce resistant rulers like the Marathas ,and Haider Ali of Mysore. The\nAnglo-Maratha wars continued from 1778 to 1782 in which power of the Marathas\nwas greatly weakened as Ahmed Shah Abdali had already inflicted a humiliating\ndefeat on them in the last battle of Panipat in 1761.In order to achieve success in\nthese military expeditions, Hastings forced many rich princes to give him heavy bribes.\nMany important Indian towns like Pune and Gwalior were captured in these wars.\nThough he couldn’t gain success against Haider Ali in the second Anglo-Mysore war,\nhe had laid a strong foundation of the future British victories in southern India.

          "question": "How successful were the British in expanding their control over\nIndian territories between 1750 and 1850? [14]",
          "answer": "Indians made several attempts against the British. They had a mix of successes and\nfailures. Since India was a huge territory with several armies under powerful Nawabs, British\ncould not have any major success till as late as 1757, in northern India. Powerful armies of\nvarious strong rulers kept British from gaining political control of these states.\nIn southern India, the Marathas and the rulers of Mysore (Deccan) also offered stiff\nresistance till 1799. The ruler of Mysore Hyder Ali, and then his son Tipu Sultan fought three\nfierce wars against the British, the Anglo-Mysore wars from 1770’s to 1799. Hyder Ali,\nassisted by his son and the French naval force, got a significant victory in 1780-1782.\nAccording to McLeod, “Hyder Ali gave a damned rap over the knuckles of the British.” He\ncaptured Carnatic, Arcot and Cuddalore in the war. After his sudden death in 1782, his son\nTipu continued to resist the British. He defeated Brigadier Mathews in 1783 and captured\nBendore and Bangalore. With success from both sides, the 2nd Anglo-Mysore war ended in\n1784 under the Treaty of Mangalore. The British had to launch a propaganda campaign\nagainst Tipu to depopularise him.\nLord Hastings was succeeded by Lord Cornwallis who fought the 3rd Anglo-Mysore\nwar against Tipu. He provoked Tipu by giving help to the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1789. Tipu\nattacked the British and the war lasted for about two years. Tipu was initially successful but\nlater had to accept the Treaty of Serangapatam in 1792.\nThe Marathas also gave very tough time to the British in the first Anglo-Mysore war,\n1775-1782. Lord Hastings policy of handling Marathas was quite defective that emboldened\nMarathas. Marathon power continued to resist British till1818.\n\n\nIn north-western India, the Sikh ruler of Punjab, Raja Ranjit Singh became a need for\nthe British due to his own power as well as the strategic location of Punjab. British needed\nhim to counter the Russian threat through Afghanistan. Moreover, the defeat of the British in\nAfghanistan in 1841 lowered their prestige in India. Mir Nisar Ali, popularly known as Titu Mir\nShaheed, offered stiff resistence to the British in the west Bengal till his killing in 1831. He\nhad raised an army of volunteer fighters, and kept it in fort of bamboos.\nHowever, Indians had a greater number of failures during this period of time. They\nsuffered their first humiliating defeat in 1757 in the battle of Plassey in Bengal. Nawab Siraj\nud Daula of Bengal fought against Robert Clive of the EIC and was defeated and killed; partly\ndue to the military superiority of the British and partly to the treachery of Mir Jafar who had\nbeen bribed by the EIC. British gained a very important north-eastern Indian territory. Second\nmajor defeat suffered by Indians was in 1764 in the battle of Buxar. A combined army, of the\nMughal ruler Shah Alam II and Nawabs of Bengal and Oudh, was crushed by the EIC solely\ndue to its superior fighting skills. A larger area of north-eastern India came under the EIC.\nIn south India, the EIC kept the Marathas, ruler of Mysore and the Nizam of\nHyderabad divided to decisively defeat Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore. Lord Wellsley’s army\ndefeated and killed Tipu Sultan in the last Anglo-Mysore war in 1799. Tipu’s general Mir Sadiq\nhad been bribed by the EIC.\nThe EIC got rid of the Marathan threat in 1818 in the 3rd and last Marathan war by\ndefeating their Peshwa Baji Rao II and got several states of southern and central India.\nIn 1803 the EIC army entered Delhi and shifted the royal court from Red Fort to Qutab\nSaheb and thus gained a major victory. Amirs of Sindh were provoked in 1843 to attack the\nBritish. This way the British had undone the damage done to their prestige in Afghanistan.\nTitu Mir was defeated by the British in 1831, and his fort of bamboos was destroyed. This\ngave British complete control over Bengal.\nFinally, the Indians lost the strategic north-western territory of Punjab and Kashmir\nbetween 1846 and 1849. The British, after their defeat in Afghanistan in 1841, decided to\nundo the damage to their prestige. Accordingly, the Amirs of Sindh were provoked by the\nBritish, and they attacked and annexed Sindh in 1843. Ranjit Singh’s death caused political\nturmoil in Punjab that was exploited by the EIC. It defeated the Sikhs in second Anglo-Sikh\nwar and annexed Punjab from 1846 to 1849.\nThe British acting wisely, forced the state princes to sign peace treaties with them.\nUnder the treaties, these states were given internal autonomy and were required to\nacknowledge the British sovereignity by paying various taxes to them.\nIt may be concluded that the Indian resistance was an utter failure because they\ncontinued to lose various territories to the British due to their own disunity and clever strategy\nand military supremacy of the British.",

          "question": "Did educational reforms have a more important effect on the\nIndians than the social, religious and economic ones introduced by\nthe British during the years 1773 to 1856? Explain your\nanswer. [14]",
          "answer": "British established themselves in India through their educational reforms. British\nhad carried a firm belief in the superiority of their culture, especially their educational\nsystem. According to a British official in 1835, \"a single shelf of a good European library\nwas worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia\". British felt justified in holding\nsuch views as they had emerged a military giant and scientifically advanced due to their\nsuccess in science and technology. They considered it their duty to spread their superior\nculture.\n\n\nThey introduced English as the official language in 1834 and gradually popularised\ntheir own education system. This scheme was master-minded by Thomas Babington\nMacaulay. Several schools, many run by .Christian missionaries, were set up throughout\nIndia, 1830 onwards. These steps had a westernising effect on India but Indians resisted\nit inwardly as they thought the British were trying to impose their culture on India.\nBritish also took steps to introduce other social reforms. They abolished Sattee, a\nHindu custom of burning widow alive on the cremation of her husband. They eradicated\nThuggee, another Hindu ritual of killing their victims in the name of a goddess. In 1830,\nColonel Sleeman's army arrested 2000 thugs. This step was welcomed by Indians as the\ncustom had terrified Hindus and Muslims alike. In 1795, female infanticide (killing baby\ndaughters) was abolished by the EIC and it was declared as an act of murder. Most Hindus\nresisted this and the ban on Sattee because they considered these British acts as direct\ninterference with the local religious and cultural traditions. Eventually, however, these\nBritish attempts had a good effect on Indian life.\nIn 1833, the EIC allowed Christian missionaries to preach in India. Accordingly,\nseveral missionaries began their mission of spreading Christianity in India. They also\nspread Western knowledge and way of life, thinking themselves superior to the local\npeople. As a result, the missionaries got intolerant towards Indians, and this caused\nresentment among Indians. Gradually, there were conversions among locals, especially\namong the Sudras. Christianity slowly emerged as a major religion in India. Also, a new\ncommunity, Anglo-Indians emerged in India.\nBritish EIC made it compulsory for Indian sepoys to serve the EIC army wherever\nneeded. According to Hindu belief, a caste Hindu would lose caste by traveling overseas\nand so, this step of EIC was condemned by Hindu community.\nBritish also affected the economy of India by their involvement with the local\neconomic matters. They imposed heavy taxes on Indians to fully exploit local resources.\nSome of the tax collectors became corrupt and kept the money with themselves. Peasants\nand small land owners were worst affected by heavy taxes. Salaries of Indian sepoys were\nkept lower than British soldiers. Indian wealth and raw materials were used to feed British\nfactories in England, while Indian markets were flooded with British manufactured goods.\nLocal products could not match these goods in quality and price. Consequently, many rich\nIndians became poor. A British official remarked on this by equating the phenomenon with\n\"a sponge, drawing up all the good things from the banks of the Ganges, and squeezing\nthem down on the banks of the Thames\". Indians felt exploited and economically ruined\nand gradually hatred grew against the British leading to the 1857 uprising.\nTo conclude, it seems that educational reforms affected Indians more than other\nreforms because, with a new education system, British were able to raise a team of Indians\nfully loyal to the British. These Indians opposed any uprising against their new rulers.",

          "question": "Was the work of the Christian missionaries the most important\nreason why the Indians opposed British attempts to westernize\nthem between 1750 and 1850? Explain your answer. (10)",
          "answer": "Christian missionaries came to India to spread Christianity by various means. 1833\nonwards, the activity of the Christian missionaries became more visible. They were seen at\nall public places, distributing the Christian literature freely. They enjoyed the support of the\nEIC. Several missionary schools were set up in all the major Indian towns where teaching of\n\n\nthe Bible to the local students was introduced. In these schools the missionaries taught\nChristianity and expected local religions to be given up which was resented by Muslims,\nHindus and Sikhs alike. Gradually, the British began to develop the belief that their Christian\nvalues made them superior to the local faith followed by the Indians: Hinduism, Islam and\nSikhism. As a result the ruling British community in India began to show intolerance towards\nthe local religions. Many Indians started believing that an alien culture was being imposed on\nthem. So, not many Indians changed their religion.\nHowever, there were other reasons why the Indians opposed the British attempts to\nwesternize them. The British replaced Persian and Sanskrit with English as the official\nlanguage in the 1830’s. This deeply upset both the Muslims and Hindus as these had been\nthe popular languages of India for centuries. Therefore, they felt the native languages might\nbe adversely affected by English because language has always been a very effective tool of\nthe ruling elite.\nThe British introduced a number of social reforms without consultation or care for local\nfeeling which caused much unrest. Modern British education was resisted by the Indians.\nMoreover, they were required to send their children to co-educational schools which was\nhated since it appeared to impose the British traditions on the Indians without due regard to\ntheir religious and cultural feelings. Thomas Macaulay believed in the superiority of the\nEuropean advancement in knowledge and therefore, he looked down upon the Indians and\nthe Arabic education system. Not surprisingly, a British official in 1835 remarked, “A single\nshelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia.”\nSuch ideas generated resentment among Indians against the British. They were more\ninfuriated when they were forced to abandon ‘purdha’/Hejab which had been an Indian\ncustom for centuries. The Muslim community, in particular, opposed such steps as they went\nagainst the fundamental teachings of Islam.\nIn 1795, female infanticide/killing of baby daughters was declared to be murder, but\nthe British found difficulty in enforcing this as it was again a tradition practiced by Hindus in\nmany parts of India. Suttee was the Hindu ritual of burning a widow alive on the cremation of\nher husband. When the British abolished it first in Bengal and then in the rest of the country,\nthey faced fierce opposition by some of the Hindu tribes. In fact many British were not in\nfavour of going to this extent of involvement in the local religious beliefs and traditions,\nsurprisingly there was little opposition to the ban on this inhuman custom. Similarly, the\nencouragement of the widow remarriage was also criticized by several Hindus.\nAnalyzing objectively, it may be concluded that the work of the Christian missionaries\nwas the most important reason for the Indian opposition to the British because religious\nbeliefs and practices had been tremendously dear to the Indians. They could go to any extent\nagainst whoever tried to intrude into this cultural sphere and that means they could make it a\nmatter of life and death when it came to imposing other religions on them.\n\n\nTHE 1857 WAR OF INDEPENDENCE\nCauses:\n(1) Political:-\n Annexation policy of the EIC → various means e.g. the “Doctrine of Lapse” by\nLord Dalhousie 1852 → capture of Oudh in 1856 → local rulers felt insecure &\nconsidered the British greedy land grabbers\n Disrespect of the Mughal rule → shifting the royal family from the Red Fort to the\nQutub Saheb by Dalhousie\n Negligible share of Indians in the civil service + 1834, English replaced Persian\nas the court language → resentment among Indians to such policies\n(2) Cultural (religious & social)\n Dominating Brit Culture +arrogant attitude towards Indians → introduction of\nroads, railways & telecommunication unacceptable to many Indians.\n Role of Christian missionaries → preaching & missionary schools → Indians felt\ntheir religious interests threatened\n(3) Economic:\n Indian Resources for Brit industry → huge profits from sale of manufactured goods\nin India → local industry declined\n Heavy taxation → unaffordable for poor & small farmers + corrupt tax collectors.\n(4) Military:\n Indians were bulk of British army, but on lower ranks only → Sepoys & Sawars\n(cavalry)\n Insulting attitude of Brit officers towards Indians\n Overseas journey, not allowed in Hinduism\n Fear of forcible conversion to Christianity\n Indian troops in Afghanistan → resented esp by Hindus\n Greased cartridges → fat of pig & cow\nCauses of failure of the War of Independence\n(1) Lack of Unity:\n Different groups with different interests in different parts of India → Hindus &\nMuslims not united → most princes not willing to restore Mughal rule → some\nprinces wanted restoration of their individual feudal powers e.g. Kashmir → power\nof its ruler depended on Brit rule.\n(2) Lack of support by many provinces:\n → the revolt was not supported by Punjab & Sindh → conquered by troops from\nBengal & Central India → they didn’t support these provinces\n(3) Lack of planning & aims:\n → Hastily organized effort → no prior planning & no co-ordinated effort → rebels\nnot clear about a common goal & so , were easily overpowered by the Brit → no\nreal sense of national patriotism\n\n\n(4) British strengths:\n Highly disciplined Brit army → a good team of generals with experience in warfare\n& fighting techniques → Brit had diplomatic skills & retained control over most of\nterritories by keeping various groups divided.\nEffects of the War\n End of the Mughal rule → strict punishment for the royal family & the last Mughal ruler,\nBahadar Shah Zafar\n Establishment of Brit rule → India because a Brit Colony.\n Harsh penalties for rebels, especially the Muslims → they were held main culprits →\npublic hangings, stitching the dead in pigskins → all respectable posts were denied\nto them.\n Brit changed their policy → no further annexation, no interference with religious\nbeliefs.\n Gradual political awakening among Indians → rise of leadership and political parties\n→ 1885, INC was founded\n Brit adopted measures to win Indian confidence → 1877 Queen of England became\nEmperess India.\nReasons for the British being able to conquer India\n(1) Indian weaknesses → disunity among various groups → no uniting force, as the\nMughal rule in process of decline.\n Many rulers sought Brit help against their rivals, instead of considering Brit as\ncommon enemy.\n Failure of many rulers to reform their states & improve social conditions → they\nlived on their past history & neglected State affairs.\n(2) British strengths → fruits of the Industrial revolution → advanced technology, superior\nweapons, better means of communication and strong confidence about their success.\n Strong sense of patriotism → main uniting force, together with a sense of superior\nculture that they wanted to spread\n Political belief to make progress & to rule a larger part of the world\n Such beliefs acted as driving force in making successful efforts to conquer India.",

          "answer": "Social reforms were resented by the Indians. British introduced a series of social\nreforms most of which were disliked by the Indians. When the Hindu custom of Sattee was\nbanned and remarriage of the widow was encouraged the Hindus reacted strongly. In Sattee\nthe widow was burned alive in the cremation ceremony of her dead husband. Most of the\nwidowed women in Hindu community were supposed not to remarry. Therefore, when British\nchanged these traditions, Hindus took this step as interference in their religious traditions.\nSimilarly the introduction of the co-education system and a discouraging attitude of the\nobservance of Hijab/Purda was resisted by the Muslims for whom these steps were against\ntheir socio-religious traditions.\nBritish started a number of social development schemes such as roads, railways and\ntelecommunications. Though they benefitted India in general, many in the north-western parts\nof India thought that British had introduced the railway system only to ensure quick movement\nof troops in case of Russian attack through Afghanistan.\nWesternization of Indian educational system was also not welcomed by a majority of\nIndians because of Lord Macaulay’s contemptuous remarks about the Indian educational\nstandard. When English began to replace Urdu and Hindi as the official language, in 1834,\nboth Hindus and Muslims opposed this as they took such measures as an onslaught on local\ncultural traditions. Generally, the British were derogatory towards Indians.\nGrowth of the activities of the Christian missionaries during the second half of 19th\ncentury also promoted a sense of insecurity among Indians specially when there were reports\nof forcible conversion of Indians into Christianity. Christian missionaries were active at all\npublic places like, schools, parks, markets and they believed it was their duty to impose a\nsuperior culture and religion on all Indians.\nIn military affairs too, the British officers treated Indian subordinates in an arrogant\nway and they were denied any promotion regardless of their services for the British. Indian\nsepoys were given lesser salaries as compared to the British soldiers. This inculcated hatred\nand frustration among Indians. When an ordinance was issued about the services of Indians\nanywhere in the world, both Hindus and the Muslims felt offended. According to Hindu belief,\na caste Hindu would become a Sudra if he travelled overseas. Muslim troops were reluctant\nto fight the fellow Afghan Muslim troops in the Company’s army.\nBritish policy of annexation was also very alarming for Indians, specially the way the\nDoctrine of lapse was enforced in 1852 by Lord Dalhousie. Under this, any state whose ruler\ndidn’t have a son was annexed by the EIC. States of Nana Sahib Peshwa (Kanpur) and Rani\nof Jhansi were unjustly annexed as both had sons. Many states were annexed by force or on\nweak pretexts such as Sindh and Bengal. After entering Delhi in 1803, the EIC shifted the\nMughal royal family from the Red Fort to Qutub Sahib. This too promoted anger among\nIndians.\nHeavy taxation on Indians and exploitation of local raw materials and wealth for the\nBritish factories in England was another major reason. As factory made better cotton began\nto replace the local hand processed cotton, millions of hand weavers of cotton were rendered\njobless and suffered from starvation and died.\nFinally, by the start of 1857, new cartridges for the Enfield rifles were introduced. It\nwas rumored that they were wrapped in the fat of cow and pig and they had to be chewed\nout before use. Hindus accorded motherly status to cows whereas for Muslims pig was Haram\n(forbidden). So, both Hindu and Muslim troops refused to use these cartridges. Mangal\nPanday was the first soldier to have refused them in March 1857 and with this the revolt\nspread to other parts of India.\nIt seems the introduction of social reforms was the most important reason because\nthe social and cultural values were very dear to Indians who took them as the first and most\n\n\nimportant mark of their identity. So, when the EIC tried to change them the Indian reaction\nwas in proportion to the British efforts.",

          "answer": "Economic exploitation of India by the British was a major reason of the War of\nIndependence. In the beginning the British traders conducted trade in a way that\nbenefited Indians, too. However, as they got control of several Indian states, they\nintroduced new trading laws and revenue reforms that were aimed at exploiting Indian\nresources and wealth. They imposed heavy taxes on Indian peasants and small\nlandowners to fill their treasury. Lord Warren Hastings introduced the concept of\nputting the tax collectors up for auction. This tempted many locals to acquire the post\nby paying heavy money to the Company. Once the ambitious candidates got the\ndesired position of tax collector, they would use all tactics to extort taxes from the\nIndians. This resulted in poverty and starvation among Indians that whipped up anger\nand resentment against the British with the passage of time. Moreover, exploitation\nof local raw materials and wealth for the British factories in England was also noticed\nwith great concern by the Indians.

      "raw_text": "\nBritish also used non-military warfare to establish themselves in India. Their “divide\nand rule” policy enabled them to annex various states by keeping their rulers hostile against\neach other. Indians had been a divided nation and many state rulers sought British help\nagainst their rivals without considering their collective interests. Many of them were bribed or\nthreatened by the EIC. They also bribed key ministers of various local rulers to win their\nsupport. Mir Ja’far in Bengal, and Mir Sadiq in Mysore played key role by switching their\nloyalties to the British. Therefore, the British achieved vital victories in the battle of Plassey\n1757 against Nawab Siraj ud Daula of Bengal, and the last Anglo-Mysore war against Tipu\nin 1799.\nBy the start of 18th century the Mughals got involved in a luxurious style of life\nneglecting state affairs. Rulers of several peripheral states became autonomous and they\nproved an easy target for the British. Weak successors of Aurangzeb gradually lost their\ncontrol over a huge empire as several local rulers became autonomous. These successors\nbecame luxury-loving, and distanced themselves from the state affairs that were given in the\nhands of greedy and selfish courtiers and ministers. These ministers were mainly concerned\nabout misusing the state funds and filling their own pockets. They remained ignorant of the\nEIC acquiring military power.\nQ: How successful was the Indian resistance against the British\nbetween 1750 and 1850?\nOr\nQ: How successful were the British in expanding their control over\nIndian territories between 1750 and 1850? [14]\nAns:\nIndians made several attempts against the British. They had a mix of successes and\nfailures. Since India was a huge territory with several armies under powerful Nawabs, British\ncould not have any major success till as late as 1757, in northern India. Powerful armies of\nvarious strong rulers kept British from gaining political control of these states.\nIn southern India, the Marathas and the rulers of Mysore (Deccan) also offered stiff\nresistance till 1799. The ruler of Mysore Hyder Ali, and then his son Tipu Sultan fought three\nfierce wars against the British, the Anglo-Mysore wars from 1770’s to 1799. Hyder Ali,\nassisted by his son and the French naval force, got a significant victory in 1780-1782.\nAccording to McLeod, “Hyder Ali gave a damned rap over the knuckles of the British.” He\ncaptured Carnatic, Arcot and Cuddalore in the war. After his sudden death in 1782, his son\nTipu continued to resist the British. He defeated Brigadier Mathews in 1783 and captured\nBendore and Bangalore. With success from both sides, the 2nd Anglo-Mysore war ended in\n1784 under the Treaty of Mangalore. The British had to launch a propaganda campaign\nagainst Tipu to depopularise him.\nLord Hastings was succeeded by Lord Cornwallis who fought the 3rd Anglo-Mysore\nwar against Tipu. He provoked Tipu by giving help to the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1789. Tipu\nattacked the British and the war lasted for about two years. Tipu was initially successful but\nlater had to accept the Treaty of Serangapatam in 1792.\nThe Marathas also gave very tough time to the British in the first Anglo-Mysore war,\n1775-1782. Lord Hastings policy of handling Marathas was quite defective that emboldened\nMarathas. Marathon power continued to resist British till1818.\n\n\nIn north-western India, the Sikh ruler of Punjab, Raja Ranjit Singh became a need for\nthe British due to his own power as well as the strategic location of Punjab. British needed\nhim to counter the Russian threat through Afghanistan. Moreover, the defeat of the British in\nAfghanistan in 1841 lowered their prestige in India. Mir Nisar Ali, popularly known as Titu Mir\nShaheed, offered stiff resistence to the British in the west Bengal till his killing in 1831. He\nhad raised an army of volunteer fighters, and kept it in fort of bamboos.\nHowever, Indians had a greater number of failures during this period of time. They\nsuffered their first humiliating defeat in 1757 in the battle of Plassey in Bengal. Nawab Siraj\nud Daula of Bengal fought against Robert Clive of the EIC and was defeated and killed; partly\ndue to the military superiority of the British and partly to the treachery of Mir Jafar who had\nbeen bribed by the EIC. British gained a very important north-eastern Indian territory. Second\nmajor defeat suffered by Indians was in 1764 in the battle of Buxar. A combined army, of the\nMughal ruler Shah Alam II and Nawabs of Bengal and Oudh, was crushed by the EIC solely\ndue to its superior fighting skills. A larger area of north-eastern India came under the EIC.\nIn south India, the EIC kept the Marathas, ruler of Mysore and the Nizam of\nHyderabad divided to decisively defeat Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore. Lord Wellsley’s army\ndefeated and killed Tipu Sultan in the last Anglo-Mysore war in 1799. Tipu’s general Mir Sadiq\nhad been bribed by the EIC.\nThe EIC got rid of the Marathan threat in 1818 in the 3rd and last Marathan war by..."

          "answer": "Indians were disunited in the War. The divide between Hindus and Muslims was\nvisible as Hindus were not sincere in restoring the Mughal rule. In different places\ndifferent groups fought for different reasons, thus weakening their own strength. The\nPunjab and Sindh had been recently annexed by the EIC with the help of troops from\nBengal and Central India. So, when the same troops rebelled against the British, the\ntwo provinces were uninterested in helping the rebellion and the Punjab actually sent\ntroops and supplies to help the British. The Maharaja of Kashmir also sent troops for\nthe same purpose.\nThere was no general plan before the start of the War that started abruptly by the\ndefiance of a single soldier Mangal Panday. The rebels perhaps forgot that they were\nfighting against a very strong nation and that required a well thought out war plan.\nDuring the course of the War, this lack of planning and coordination became more\nprominent as various rebel groups did not know how to proceed in case of any\nsuccess. This helped the British to regain their control within a year. Rebels began to\nplunder their fellow countrymen after taking control of many cities. Thus the affected\npeople preferred to leak information to the British about the rebels.\nThe British had a professionally trained army with several experienced commanders\nwho had been trained to deal with such emergencies.

          "question": "A lack of unity was the main reason for the failure of the War of\nIndependence. Do you agree? Explain. [14]",
          "answer": "Indians were not united in the War. Right from the beginning the Hindu-Muslim divide\nwas evident. Hindus had no reason to fight for the restoration of the Mughal rule in\nIndia. So, on many fronts both communities did not support each other. At many\nplaces different groups fought for different reasons. The only real uniting force was\nIslam as the Mughal rule had been established by the Muslim community. Being a\nminority in India and ruling it for centuries, the Muslims were more prepared than other\ncommunities to oppose the British. Therefore, any degree of unity among Muslims\ngreatly alarmed the Hindus and Sikhs. That is one major reason why the British\nviewed the War of Independence as predominantly a ‘Muslim revolt’.\nMoreover, some of the rulers were ready to withdraw from the War if the British\npromised to fulfill their demands e.g. Nana Saheb Peshwa. Some of the state princes\nwere interested only in restoring their own feudal powers. In some cases their powers\nactually depended on the support of the British. That is why the ruler of Kashmir sent\n2000 troops to help the British. This greatly weakened the spirit of the uprising on the\nwhole.\nThe rebel forces were generally not well-organised, and did not have a\nconcrete common goal ahead of them. Such rebels, in fact, gave vent to their\nfrustration and anger due to their growing poverty. This is why many of them began\nto plunder their fellow countrymen after taking control of many cities. Thus the affected\npeople preferred to leak information to the British about the rebels instead of\nsupporting them. This disunity was a blessing for the British who fully exploited it, and\nbegan to regain control over the lost territories.\nThe uprising was a hasty and unplanned desperate attempt by the troops after\nMangal Pandey’s refusal to use the grease cartridges. This encouraged sepoys in\nsome other provinces to defy their British officers, too. Consequently most of the\nIndian troops from selected provinces stood up against the British without any proper\nplanning. As the uprising spread to other provinces, there was no coordination among\ntroops about the future line of action. This became a major reason for the failure of\nthe War of Independence.\nBritish, on the other hand, had many strengths. They were one of the powerful\nnations of the world with sophisticated and destructive weapons. They had a regular,\nhighly disciplined and professionally trained army. Their skilled military commanders\ncarried a strong sense of success due to their professional training. British army had\nbeen trained in dealing with such emergencies. The rebels, on the other hand, did not\nhave any such leaders to counter the British. Therefore, they retained control of about\n3/4th of their possessions and restricted the uprising to a smaller belt of northern and\ncentral Indian provinces. They also had a strong sense of success due to their\nvictories in other parts of the world. They skillfully followed their policy of “divide and\nrule” when they saw the Indian inherent disunity. They applied both military and non-\nmilitary tactics in a diplomatic way in exploiting the weakness of several Indian rulers\nwho were fighting to regain their own rule. As a result, the British kept control in more\nthan three quarters of their possessions.\nIt may be concluded that a lack of unity was the decisive factor for the failure of the\nWar because in case all Indians had become united, it might have been impossible\nfor the British to put down the uprising, keeping in mind the size of Indian population.",

          "question": "The War of Independence achieved nothing/little for the Indians. Do\nyou agree? Explain. [14]",
          "answer": "The 1857 War led to disastrous consequences. As far as its immediate results are\nconcerned they brought miseries to Indians in general and to Muslims in particular. Muslims\nwere exclusively targetted because British had taken political control from them and they\nwanted to erase any sense of “imperial pride” from their minds. At many places mass\nexecutions were carried out publicly and the dead were stitched in the pigskin. Muslims were\ndenied all respectable posts. Raids were conducted at the houses of several notable people\non the ground of suspicion and harsh treatment was meted out in general. Sepoys were\nblown away by tying their bodies at the mouths of the cannons. The purpose was to create\nawe and horror in the minds of the Indians.\nMughal rule was officially abolished and the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar\nwas exiled to Rangoon (Myanmar/Burma) where his sons were beheaded and he himself\nwas given death sentence that was commuted to life imprisonment due to his advanced age.\nIndia became a British colony.\nBritish also became cautious and selective in military matters. They began to recruit\ntroops from the relatively loyal provinces such as Punjab KP and Kashmir, and followed the\npolicy of encouraging the “martial race” of Pathans and Punjabis.\nHowever, gradually it became apparent that the War gave Indians something positive,\ntoo. Indians had learned the hard lesson that militarily they were no match to the British.\nTherefore, now they would resist British rule politically. As a result Indians began to develop\npolitical awareness and founded political parties ___ INC in 1885 and ML in 1906. Indians\ngot leaders and reformers like Sir Syed, Bal Ganga Dhar Tilak, Gandhi and Jinnah.\nBritish government abolished the EIC under Allahabad Declaration of 1858. Under\nthis, all annexation policies were abandoned e.g. the doctrine of lapse. British government\npromised respect of local religious faiths and practices. They also decided to train Indians in\npolitics by introducing political reforms periodically. Queen of England adopted the additional\ntitle of “Empress of India” in 1877 in order to win the Indian confidence.\nBritish government introduced a “chain of command” to govern India. British\nparliament would make laws for India with the assistance of a Secretary of State for India and\na Viceroy. Secretary of State would visit India when needed while the Viceroy was stationed\nin India. He was assisted by a team of governors (always British) and the Viceroy’s Executive\nCouncil.\nIn the final analysis, it seems that the War of 1857 was on the whole a failed attempt\nby Indians as it failed to achieve the primary objective of driving the British out of India.\nInstead, the British eliminated the Mughal rule forever. India would now be governed directly\nby the British government for another nine decades.",

      "raw_text": "\nIn military affairs too, the British officers treated Indian subordinates in an arrogant\nway and they were denied any promotion regardless of their services for the British.\nIndian sepoys were given lesser salaries as compared to the British soldiers. This\ninculcated hatred and frustration among Indians. When an ordinance was issued\nabout the services of Indians anywhere in the world, both Hindus and the Muslims felt\noffended. According to Hindu belief, a caste Hindu would become Sudra if he travelled\noverseas. Muslim troops were reluctant to fight the fellow Afghan Muslim troops in the\nCompany’s army.\nBritish policy of annexation was also very alarming for Indians, specially the way the\nDoctrine of lapse was enforced in 1852 by Lord Dalhousie. Under this, any state\nwhose ruler didn’t have a son was annexed by the EIC. States of Nana Sahib Peshwa\n(Kanpur) and Rani of Jhansi were unjustly annexed as both had sons. Many states\nwere annexed by force or on weak pretexts such as Sindh and Bengal. After entering\nDelhi in 1803, the EIC shifted the Mughal royal family from the Red Fort to Qutub\nSahib. This too promoted anger among Indians.\nFinally, by the start of 1857, new cartridges for the Enfield rifles were introduced. It\nwas rumored that they were wrapped in the fat of cow and pig and they had to be\nchewed out before use. Hindus accorded motherly status to cows whereas for\nMuslims pig was Haram (forbidden). So, both Hindu and Muslim troops refused to use\nthese cartridges. Mangal Panday was the first soldier to have refused them in March\n1857 and with this the revolt spread to other parts of India.\nIt seems the economic reforms became the main reason of the 1857 war because\nwith rising poverty, unemployment, hunger and starvation, the Indians felt themselves\nbeing pushed to the wall. The cumulative anger and frustration finally burst into a\ncollective though desperate uprising against the British.\nQ: Why did the Indians not achieve independence in 1857?\nor\nExplain the reasons for the failure of the War of Independence. (7)\nAns. Indians were disunited in the War. The divide between Hindus and Muslims was\nvisible as Hindus were not sincere in restoring the Mughal rule. In different places\ndifferent groups fought for different reasons, thus weakening their own strength. The\nPunjab and Sindh had been recently annexed by the EIC with the help of troops from\nBengal and Central India. So, when the same troops rebelled against the British, the\ntwo provinces were uninterested in helping the rebellion and the Punjab actually sent\ntroops and supplies to help the British. The Maharaja of Kashmir also sent troops for\nthe same purpose.\nThere was no general plan before the start of the War that started abruptly by the\ndefiance of a single soldier Mangal Panday. The rebels perhaps forgot that they were\nfighting against a very strong nation and that required a well thought out war plan.\nDuring the course of the War, this lack of planning and coordination became more\nprominent as various rebel groups did not know how to proceed in case of any\nsuccess. This helped the British to regain their control within a year. Rebels began to\nplunder their fellow countrymen after taking control of many cities. Thus the affected\npeople preferred to leak information to the British about the rebels.\nThe British had a professionally trained army with several experienced commanders\nwho had been trained to deal with such emergencies. They had been familiar with the\nmodern methods of fighting a huge army with a lesser number of troops. Moreover,\n\n\nthe British had a strong sense of success as they were one of the most powerful\nnations of the world at that time. So, their confident and disciplined army took little\ntime in overcoming the revolt.\n\n\nQ: A lack of unity was the main reason for the failure of the War of\nIndependence. Do you agree? Explain. [14]\nAns:\nIndians were not united in the War. Right from the beginning the Hindu-Muslim divide\nwas evident. Hindus had no reason to fight for the restoration of the Mughal rule in\nIndia. So, on many fronts both communities did not support each other. At many\nplaces different groups fought for different reasons. The only real uniting force was\nIslam as the Mughal rule had been established by the Muslim community. Being a\nminority in India and ruling it for centuries, the Muslims were more prepared than other\ncommunities to oppose the British. Therefore, any degree of unity among Muslims\ngreatly alarmed the Hindus and Sikhs. That is one major reason why the British\nviewed the War of Independence as predominantly a ‘Muslim revolt’.\nMoreover, some of the rulers were ready to withdraw from the War if the British\npromised to fulfill their demands e.g. Nana Saheb Peshwa. Some of the state princes\nwere interested only in restoring their own feudal powers. In some cases their powers\nactually depended on the support of the British. That is why the ruler of Kashmir sent\n2000 troops to help the British. This greatl..."

          "question": "Why did Shah Wali Ullah wish to revive Islam in the sub-continent?\n(7)",
          "answer": "Shah Wali Ullah was a great reformer. He was born in 1703, only four years before\nthe death of Aurangzeb. Therefore, he was a witness to, and worried over the process of the\ndecline of the Mughal Empire and the deteriorating condition of the Indian Muslims. He\nbelieved that the main reason of the miserable condition of the Muslims was their ignorance\nof Quran and Sunnah. Persian, the court language, was understood by the educated Muslim\nelite. So, he translated the Quran into Persian language. This way a greater number of\nMuslims could understand and follow the Quranic teachings.\nIn order to create awareness among Muslims regarding the problems faced by them\nand the possible solutions to the problems, he wrote several books. The most famous book\nwas, “Hujjat Ullah al-Baligha” in which he analysed the problems of the Muslim community.\nIn “Izalat ul Khafa”(usually misspelt as Izalat ul Ikhfa), he tried to remove the differences\nbetween the two major sects of Islam, Sunni and Shi’a Muslims. In this he wrote the\nbiographies of the Four Rightly Guided Caliphs in a way acceptable to both the major sects.\nHe also advised Muslims to work honestly and with dedication if they really wanted to\ncome out of a state of helplessness and ignorance that they had inherited from their corrupt,\nweak and luxury loving rulers. As a result of this, there were several threats to the Mughal\nrule in India both from within and outside. He emphasized the importance of Jihad against a\ncommon enemy. Therefore, he invited Ahmed Shah Abdali of Afghanistan to save it.\nAccordingly, Abdali broke the backbone of the South Indian militant Hindu community, the\nMarathas. He defeated them in the third and last Battle of Panipat in 1761, though he himself\ndid not stay back in India.\n\n\nSyed Ahmed Shaheed Barelvi (SASB) (1786-1831)\nIntroduction:\n Born 1786, Rae Bareli, near Lucknow in a Syed family\n 1806, father’s death, studied in Madrassa-i-Rahimiya, under sons of SWU.\n 1810, joined army of Amir Khan, a Pathan leader; learned military skills; returned to\nDelhi; 1817; to Arabia, 1821-1823; strongly influenced by Sheikh Abdul Wahab\n(founder of the Wahabi movement)\n Started his J.M. (Jehad Movement) 1823, against Sikhs of Punjab.\n 1831, last battle against the Sikhs forces at Balakot (Abbotabad), was defeated &\nkilled together with most of his soldiers (Mujahideen).\nHis beliefs / reasons for his work:\n Freedom of Indian Muslims by Jehad or armed struggle; several parts of India under\nthe rule of non-Muslims, mainly, wanted to restore Muslim rule.\n Wanted to eradicate un-Islamic elements in order to ensure moral, intellectual &\nspiritual revival of Muslims; need to end evils & corruptions in Muslim society.\n Strong Sikh rule in Punjab & weak Mughal rule due to British policy\n Tyrant Sikh rule under Ranjit Singh, made lives of Muslims quite difficult\n Ban on Azan, congregational prayers; use of Badshahi mosque, Lhr as stable by\nSikh army.\nWork / Services:\n Influenced thousands of Muslims on his way to Arabia, 1821; urged them for Jehad.\n 1823, returned form Arabia, ready for Jehad; raised a team of volunteer fighters,\nMujahideen.\n Extensive tours of Punjab, NWFP/KPK (then part of Punjab), Sindh, Rajasthan,\neven Afghanistan\n 1826, headquarters near Peshawar; ultimatum to Ranjit Singh to grant liberty to\nMuslims; Ranjit dismissed it, 1st fight at Okara; 2nd near Hazro – defeat of Sikhs\n More joined & soon, 80,000 Mujahideen though the troops disagreed on may issues\ndue to varying cultural backgrounds.\n Unanimously declared as the Imam (leader), 1827; got religious & political authority\nto unify the Mujahideen.\n Local Pathan tribal chief, Yar Muahammad Khan, was bribed by Sikhs; began to\nleak information to Sikhs about SAS; Yar Muhammad tried to assassinate SAS,\nthen deserted him when SAS was about to attack the Attock Fort.\n Shifted headquarter to Panjtrar, Kashmir.\n Sultan Khan, brother of Yar, also turned against SAS; shifted to Balakot in order to\nliberate Kashmir, Hazara etc.\n Surprise attack by a huge Sikh force in Balakot, 1831\n Defeat & killing of SAS & 1863 by the British.\n\n\nImportance of work of SAS:\n First example of an armed struggle aimed at liberating Muslims from the tyranny of\nnon-Muslim rule.\n J.M. attempted to achieve religious & spiritual freedom of Muslims; his mission was\nnot about replacing a non-Muslim ruler with some particular Muslim ruler.\n Source of inspiration and unification for Muslims belonging to various sects and\ncreeds & parts of Indian, ready to fight for a common cause.\n J. M. was a fore-runner of Pakistan Movement; both were aimed at liberating the\nMuslim majority areas of India from the Non-Muslim rule.\nReasons for the failure of Jihad Movement:\n Loss of local support; Syed’s army was maintained & accommodated by Pathan\ntribes but soon the tribal chiefs were bribed by Sikhs; they withdraw support for\nMujahideen.\n Lack of a professional army; Mujahideen were mainly volunteers from various walks\nof life, e.g., teachers, students & scholars against a skilled army of Sikhs; difficult to\ncontinue fight for a longer period.\n Differences among Mujahideen due to sectarian differences; SAS exerted energies\nto keep them united for a common cause; Sikhs exploited the situation of these\ndifferences in order to weaken the spirit of J.M.\nSyed Ahmed Shaheed Barelvi (SASB) (1786-1831)",

He could see the British\nestablishing their rule over various parts of India as a result of which Muslims were fast losing\ntheir dominant position and importance in India. The EIC had annexed the important Muslim\nmajority province of Bengal and the neighbouring north-eastern Indian territories and was\nadvancing towards the north-western Muslim majority province. He thought that Muslims\ncould achieve freedom by waging Jehad/armed struggle against the non-Muslims.\nBeing a man of action he could act as a strong leader to work against British power\nin India and to struggle to restore the Muslim rule over various Indian territories. He believed\nthat there was a need to eliminate the evils that were corrupting the beliefs and practices of\nthe Indian Muslims as a result of growing non-Muslim influence during the 19th century.\nSASB could see the British policy of restricting the powers of the Mughal Emperors\nand strengthening the non-Muslims in various parts of India. For example, the Punjab was a\nMuslim majority province but was ruled by the non-Muslim minority of Sikhs. The ruler, Raja\nRanjit Singh was very hostile towards Muslims. They could not deliver Azan and, therefore,\nfound it difficult to offer prayer in congregation. The Badshahi Mosque of Lahore was denied\nto Muslims and used as a stable by the Sikh forces.

HSU believed that such a scenario demanded India to be declared Dar-ul-Harb\n(literally the battle field meaning thereby a land under non-Muslim rule till it is liberated\nand becomes Dar-ul-Islam). In such a land the Friday and Eid congregational prayers\ncould not be offered till its liberation.\nIn a way HSU supported the idea of Jehad against the non-Muslims (Hindus and\nBritish) who were undermining the true principles of Islam through their oppressive\nand coercive policies. Bengali Muslims were restricted to ordinary jobs like workers\non a farm, and they were given few opportunities in education and employment.\nAmidst these circumstances, HSU thought it important to launch his Faraizi\nMovement.",

He translated the Quran into Persian, the court language at\nthat time. This way, more Muslims could understand and follow the Quranic teachings.\nHe also believed Muslims needed to be united and avoid sectarian divide in order to\nensure their survival. He worked for the Sunni-Shi’a unity, and for this wrote\nbiographies of the four caliphs acceptable to both Sunni and Shi’a Muslims, “Izala tul\nKhifa”.\nSyed Ahmed Shaheed believed that Jihad was needed to liberate Muslims of Punjab\nfrom the tyrant Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh who treated Muslims with humiliation. In Punjab,\nAzan was banned and the Badshahi Mosque, Lahore was used as a stable by the\nSikh army as a token of disregard for the religious beliefs and practices of Muslims.\nTherefore, Syed Ahmad Shaheed raised an army of around 80,000 Mujahideen and\nfounded the Jihad Movement against the oppressive Sikh rule in Punjab.\nHaji Shari’at Ullah believed that Muslims of Bengal were suffering because of their\nneglect of the Faraiz (religious obligations). Bengali Muslims were generally poor and\nbackward due to the dominance of the British in the region since 1757. Haji Shari’at\nUllah wanted to improve their socio-economic conditions and create political\nawareness among them. In order to do so, he believed that they needed to fulfill their\nFaraiz, the daily prayers, the fast of Ramadan etc. Only then they could improve their\nmiserable condition while living under the British rule and the rich Hindu\nzamindars/rich landowners. So, he started his Faraizi Movement in East Bengal to\ncreate awareness among the poor Bengali Muslims and unite them for the common\ncause of improving their religious and socioeconomic conditions.",

          "answer": "Shah Wali Ullah was a great scholar and reformer. He belonged to a scholarly family.\nHe was educated at Madrasa-i-Rahimiya that was founded by his father. He was\nworried about the declining Mughal rule and the deteriorating socio-economic and\npolitical conditions of Indian Muslims. He analyzed the reasons for the poor condition\nof the Muslims. Muslims had started forgetting the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah\nand were divided into various sects. He spent many years in Arabia and returned with\na clear vision to revive Islam in India. He translated the Holy Quran into the court\nlanguage Persian so that many Muslims could understand and follow its teachings.\nHe wrote several books in Persian and Arabic. His most remarkable book is Hujjat\nUllah al Baligha. In another book Izalatul Khafa’an Khilafatul Khulafa (Removal of\nAmbiguity about the Caliphate of the early Caliphs) he wrote the biographies of the\nfour successors of the Prophet in a way acceptable to Sunni and Shi’a Muslims. In\norder to eliminate the Marathan threat to the Mughal rule he invited Ahmad Shah\nAbadali from Afghanistan who defeated the Marathas in the third battle of Panipat,\n1761. His mission was continued by his four scholarly sons and several followers.\nSyed Ahmed Shaheed Brailvi was dismayed at the fast decline of the Mughal Empire\nand the growing influence of non-Muslim forces. He believed that, under a policy,\nMuslims were being kept weaker than the Hindus and Sikhs. Being inspired by the\nteaching and sons of SWU, he decided to wage Jihad (armed struggle), to liberate\nIndian Muslims from the non-Muslim rule. He was especially worried about the Punjabi\nMuslims who led a miserable life under the Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh. They were\nsubjected to several humiliations and were denied religious liberty. Azan was banned\nand the Badshahi Mosque, Lahore was used as a stable by the Sikh forces. After\nreturning from Arabia, SASB raised a huge army of volunteer Mujahideen and shifted\nto the NWF where he was supported by the Pathan tribes against Sikhs. Under his\nJihad movement he defeated the Sikh forces in various battles till 1830. Finally, due\nto the betrayal of the Pathan chiefs, and sectarian divide in his army he was defeated\nand killed by the Sikhs in the battle of Balakot in 1831. He gave courage to the Indian\nMuslims by inculcating the idea of physical struggle for their survival. Jihad movement\nwas continued till the 1860s. It is considered to be the forerunner of the Pakistan\nMovement as both were aimed at liberating the Muslim majority areas from the non\nMuslim rule.",

      "raw_text": "\nQ. Why did Shah Wali Ullah wish to revive Islam in the sub-continent?\n(7)\nAns:\nShah Wali Ullah was a great reformer. He was born in 1703, only four years before\nthe death of Aurangzeb. Therefore, he was a witness to, and worried over the process of the\ndecline of the Mughal Empire and the deteriorating condition of the Indian Muslims. He\nbelieved that the main reason of the miserable condition of the Muslims was their ignorance\nof Quran and Sunnah. Persian, the court language, was understood by the educated Muslim\nelite. So, he translated the Quran into Persian language. This way a greater number of\nMuslims could understand and follow the Quranic teachings.\nIn order to create awareness among Muslims regarding the problems faced by them\nand the possible solutions to the problems, he wrote several books. The most famous book\nwas, “Hujjat Ullah al-Baligha” in which he analysed the problems of the Muslim community.\nIn “Izalat ul Khafa”(usually misspelt as Izalat ul Ikhfa), he tried to remove the differences\nbetween the two major sects of Islam, Sunni and Shi’a Muslims. In this he wrote the\nbiographies of the Four Rightly Guided Caliphs in a way acceptable to both the major sects.\nHe also advised Muslims to work honestly and with dedication if they really wanted to\ncome out of a state of helplessness and ignorance that they had inherited from their corrupt,\nweak and luxury loving rulers. As a result of this, there were several threats to the Mughal\nrule in India both from within and outside. He emphasized the importance of Jihad against a\ncommon enemy. Therefore, he invited Ahmed Shah Abdali of Afghanistan to save it.\nAccordingly, Abdali broke the backbone of the South Indian militant Hindu community, the\nMarathas. He defeated them in the third and last Battle of Panipat in 1761, though he himself\ndid not stay back in India.\n\n\nSyed Ahmed Shaheed Barelvi (SASB) (1786-1831)\nIntroduction:\n Born 1786, Rae Bareli, near Lucknow in a Syed family\n 1806, father’s death, studied in Madrassa-i-Rahimiya, under sons of SWU.\n 1810, joined army of Amir Khan, a Pathan leader; learned military skills; returned to\nDelhi; 1817; to Arabia, 1821-1823; strongly influenced by Sheikh Abdul Wahab\n(founder of the Wahabi movement)\n Started his J.M. (Jehad Movement) 1823, against Sikhs of Punjab.\n 1831, last battle against the Sikhs forces at Balakot (Abbotabad), was defeated &\nkilled together with most of his soldiers (Mujahideen).\nHis beliefs / reasons for his work:\n Freedom of Indian Muslims by Jehad or armed struggle; several parts of India under\nthe rule of non-Muslims, mainly, wanted to restore Muslim rule.\n Wanted to eradicate un-Islamic elements in order to ensure moral, intellectual &\nspiritual revival of Muslims; need to end evils & corruptions in Muslim society.\n Strong Sikh rule in Punjab & weak Mughal rule due to British policy\n Tyrant Sikh rule under Ranjit Singh, made lives of Muslims quite difficult\n Ban on Azan, congregational prayers; use of Badshahi mosque, Lhr as stable by\nSikh army.\nWork / Services:\n Influenced thousands of Muslims on his way to Arabia, 1821; urged them for Jehad.\n 1823, returned form Arabia, ready for Jehad; raised a team of volunteer fighters,\nMujahideen.\n Extensive tours of Punjab, NWFP/KPK (then part of Punjab), Sindh, Rajasthan,\neven Afghanistan\n 1826, headquarters near Peshawar; ultimatum to Ranjit Singh to grant liberty to\nMuslims; Ranjit dismissed it, 1st fight at Okara; 2nd near Hazro – defeat of Sikhs\n More joined & soon, 80,000 Mujahideen though the troops disagreed on may issues\ndue to varying cultural backgrounds.\n Unanimously declared as the Imam (leader), 1827; got religious & political authority\nto unify the Mujahideen.\n Local Pathan tribal chief, Yar Muahammad Khan, was bribed by Sikhs; began to\nleak information to Sikhs about SAS; Yar Muhammad tried to assassinate SAS,\nthen deserted him when SAS was about to attack the Attock Fort.\n Shifted headquarter to Panjtrar, Kashmir.\n Sultan Khan, brother of Yar, also turned against SAS; shifted to Balakot in order to\nliberate Kashmir, Hazara etc.\n Surprise attack by a huge Sikh force in Balakot, 1831\n Defeat & killing of SAS & 1863 by the British.\n\n\nImportance of work of SAS:\n First example of an armed struggle aimed at liberating Muslims from the tyranny of\nnon-Muslim rule.\n J.M. attempted to achieve religious & spiritual freedom of Muslims; his mission was\nnot about replacing a non-Muslim ruler with some particular Muslim ruler.\n Source of inspiration and unification for Muslims belonging to various sects and\ncreeds & parts of Indian, ready to fight for a common cause.\n J. M. was a fore-runner of Pakistan Movement; both were aimed at liberating the\nMuslim majority areas of India from the Non-Muslim rule.\nReasons for the failure of Jihad Movement:\n Loss of local support; Syed’s army was maintained & accommodated by Pathan\ntribes but soon the tribal chiefs were bribed by Sikhs; they withdraw support for\nMujahideen.\n..."

Sir Syed strongly opposed this demand and predicted\nthat in future there might be separation between Hindus and Muslims.\nIn the 1880’s, the Hindu-dominated INC (Indian National Congress) made two more\ndemands that were apparently democratic but in reality against the interest of\nMuslims. It demanded that elections of the councils in India should be held on the\nbasis of modern Western democracy. Sir Syed countered this demand by saying that\nHindus, being a majority, and politically more vibrant, might win election on all seats.\nHe suggested the idea of separate electorates for Muslims.\nFinally, he opposed another demand of the Congress that asked for the competitive\nexaminations for the Civil Services in India. He knew that Hindus were far more\neducated than Muslims and therefore, there was little chance for Muslims to get any\nseat in the Civil Services. He argued that only when equal educational opportunities\nwere provided to both the communities could such an idea work.",

          "question": "Was the Two Nation Theory the most important contribution of Sir\nSyed Ahmed Khan towards the welfare of Muslims? (14)",
          "answer": "Sir Syed was a great reformer. His views about the possibility of the parting of ways\nof Hindus and Muslims became known as the Two Nation Theory'. In 1867, he was shocked\nover the Hindu demand of making Hindi as the official language of India. Being a far-sighted\nleader, he opposed it as he could sense the Hindu aims about the future political scenario of\nIndia. Urdu, written in Persian/Arabic script reflected the past Muslim rule over India. Hindi,\nwith the Devanagri script, on the other hand, represented the Hindu plans of ruling India. He\nalso opposed two more demands of INC in the 1880's: competitive examinations for the civil\nservices and the joint electorate for the elections of the legislative councils. He knew that\nMuslims, being less educated and politically less organized, would not be able to compete\nwith the Hindus in the examinations and elections. He, therefore, advocated a system of\nseparate electorates for Muslims and a fixed quota for Muslims in the competitive\nexaminations. Sir Syed initially wanted cooperation between Hindus and Muslims but his\nviews soon changed when he realized the INC only claimed to represent all Indian\ncommunities whereas in reality it worked mainly for the Hindu interests. In order to protect\nthe political rights of the Muslims he founded the United Patriotic Alliance which was renamed\nas the Muhammadan Defence Alliance in 1893.\nSir Syed also tried to create awareness among Muslims by convincing them to accept the\nBritish as the new rulers of India and so, it was wise to make friends with them. He highlighted\nthe similarities between Islam and Christianity by writing \"Taba’yeen-al-Kalam\". In another\nbook he proved that it was not un-lslamic to dine with the Christians. He wrote a book in\nresponse to Sir William Muir's book \"Life of Muhammad\" that contained some objectionable\nremarks about the Holy Prophet.\nWhile convincing Muslims Sir Syed worked to convince British about changing their\nstance regarding Muslims. He wrote two pamphlets shortly after the War of\nIndependence. In \"Essays on the Causes of Indian Revolt\" he proved that Indians\nalone were not responsible for the Revolt but British too were to blame for their failure\nto understand the Indian mindset. In \"Loyal Muhammadans of India\" he defended\nMuslims and proved that they were as loyal to the British as any other community in\nIndia. He also explained the word \"Nadarath\" by proving it was an Anglicised form of\nthe Arabic word \"Nasara\" (Christians) that was derived from the root word \"Nasr\"\n(Help) and thus proved that Muslims did not use the word in a derogatory way.\nSir Syed's educational work was also very important. He wanted to improve social\ncondition of Muslims and to create political awareness among them. For this Muslims\nneeded to acquire modern British education. He set up a series of institutes, issued\nmagazines and wrote books. In 1859 he opened a school in Mura da bad, another\nschool in Ghazipore in 1864 where he had founded the Ghazipore Scientific Society\nin 1863. In it modern scientific writings of the West were translated into Persian and\nUrdu. In 1866, he issued the Aligarh Institute Gazette from Aligarh to encourage\nMuslims to acquire modern education. He visited England in 1869 and decided to set\nup an institute for Muslims after observing the Cambridge and Oxford Universities. In\n1875, he set up the MAO College, Aligarh where both western and local educations\nwere imparted. This institute produced many prominent leaders like Liaqat Ali Khan\nand several workers of the Pakistan Movement. In 1886, Muhammadan Educational\nConference was established in order to launch a campaign for raising educational\nstandard of Muslims. It held regular meetings in several cities. Articles for the purpose\nwere published in the journal /Tahzeeb-ul-Akhlaq/.\nIf viewed objectively, it may be concluded that Sir Syed's Two Nation Theory was his\n\n\nmost important service as it laid the basis of Muslim nationalism that eventually\nevolved into the Pakistan Movement in the 1940's. ML launched this movement on\nthe ground of inherent differences between Hindus and Muslims that had been\npredicted by Sir Syed.",

          "question": "Urdu was chosen as national language mainly to promote national\nunity. Do you agree or disagree? Explain. (14)",
          "answer": "Urdu remains the most popular language in Pakistan. Being a newly created state,\nPakistan needed to inculcate a strong sense of nationalism among its people.\nLanguage has always been a strong and effective tool in promoting patriotism in any\npart of the world. Jinnah was, therefore, advised to follow the policy of “One Nation\nOne Language”. By speaking the same language people of Pakistan were expected\nto develop a feeling of belonging to one nation, though Bengali in East Pakistan was\nalso a major language. It was thought to bridge the provincial and regional gaps in a\ncountry with diversified linguistic heritage. Thus, people living in various provinces\nand areas could be linked to each other by a ‘lingua franca’ (popularly spoken\nlanguage).\nHowever, there were other important considerations too. Out of all the regional\nlanguages Urdu was the most developed language with a strong and rich literary\nbackground. In its journey of evolution many Urdu novels, short stories, essays,\nreligious and non-religious writings had become popular much before the creation of\nPakistan. Urdu is among those few languages that have as many as three great poets:\nMir Taqi Mir, Ghalib and Iqbal. Translations of the Quran, Hadith, biography of the\nHoly Prophet and Islamic jurisprudence further enriched the Urdu literature. So, it was\neasier to adopt such a highly developed language as the national language.\nUrdu had a history of long association with the Indian Muslims. Its Persian/Arabic\nscript reflects that it remained more popular among the Muslims of India. During the\nperiod of the Sultanate of Delhi (1206-1526), such major poets as Amir Khusrau\n(1253-1325), Quli Qutub Shah and Wali Deccani all composed high quality Urdu\nverse. Then, during the Mughal rule it was greatly patronized by the Mughal Court.\nWith the passage of time, it began to replace Persian. During the 18th and 19th\ncenturies several Urdu poets became prominent like Mir Dard, Sauda, Momin, Zauq,\nand the last Mughal king Bahadur Shah Zafar. The Aligarh Movement produced many\ngood poets and writers like Hali and Shibli.\nAnother important reason was Urdu’s close association with the Pakistan Movement.\nSir Syed had defended Urdu as the cultural identity of Muslims when Hindus in 1867,\ndemanded that Hindi should be made the official language of India. When Muslim\nLeague was formed in 1906, its objectives also included protection and promotion of\nUrdu. In the 1930’s the Muslim League began to consider that Urdu as its official\nlanguage. In 1937, the Muslim League to make all efforts possible to make Urdu their\nofficial language. Later in the 1940’s Urdu newspapers highlighted the cause of the\nPakistan Movement and the activities of its leaders.\nIt may be concluded that Urdu was declared as the national language primarily to\nfoster a sense of national unity because language is one of the strongest marks of\ncultural identity of any nation, and since the creation of Pakistan was a new\nexperience for its people, they needed to realise that they had their own distinct\nidentity as a nation.",

          "answer": "Regional languages form the basis of cultural identity of Pakistan along with Urdu.\nWith the declaration of Urdu as the national language, government decided to\npromote regional languages, too. Sindhi, among all regional languages, was the first\nto have adopted the Arabic script. This reflects its close association with Islam.\nSeveral sufi poets, such as Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai and Sachal Sarmast wrote Sindhi\nverse. Therefore, it was important to promote it. After 1947, many institutes were set\nup to promote Sindhi. They include Sachal Sarmast Academy and the Department of\nSindhology in the University of Sindh.\nPashto is spoken in Khyber Pakhtoon Khwa (former NWFP) and its literature carries\na strong element of resistance against the foreign rule. Such an element of resistance\nis quite visible in the poetry of Khushhal Khan Khattak and Rehman Baba. This way\nPashto became associated with the Pakistan movement. Therefore, after\nindependence, Islamia College Peshawar and University of Peshawar contributed to\nthe development of Pashto.\nBalochi is spoken in the largest province in terms of its area but the least populated\nprovince. It had traditionally been underdeveloped due to a lack of its preservation in\nwritten form. Also, the people of Balochistan had to be assured of their significance\nas a cultural unit of Pakistan and so, it had to be promoted. For many years after\nindependence, Radio Pakistan Karachi, and later PTV Karachi began to broadcast\nBalochi programmes. In the early 1970s, PTV Quetta started to promote Balochi.",

      "raw_text": "\nQ. Urdu was chosen as national language mainly to promote national\nunity. Do you agree or disagree? Explain. (14)\nAns. Urdu remains the most popular language in Pakistan. Being a newly created state,\nPakistan needed to inculcate a strong sense of nationalism among its people.\nLanguage has always been a strong and effective tool in promoting patriotism in any\npart of the world. Jinnah was, therefore, advised to follow the policy of “One Nation\nOne Language”. By speaking the same language people of Pakistan were expected\nto develop a feeling of belonging to one nation, though Bengali in East Pakistan was\nalso a major language. It was thought to bridge the provincial and regional gaps in a\ncountry with diversified linguistic heritage. Thus, people living in various provinces\nand areas could be linked to each other by a ‘lingua franca’ (popularly spoken\nlanguage).\nHowever, there were other important considerations too. Out of all the regional\nlanguages Urdu was the most developed language with a strong and rich literary\nbackground. In its journey of evolution many Urdu novels, short stories, essays,\nreligious and non-religious writings had become popular much before the creation of\nPakistan. Urdu is among those few languages that have as many as three great poets:\nMir Taqi Mir, Ghalib and Iqbal. Translations of the Quran, Hadith, biography of the\nHoly Prophet and Islamic jurisprudence further enriched the Urdu literature. So, it was\neasier to adopt such a highly developed language as the national language.\nUrdu had a history of long association with the Indian Muslims. Its Persian/Arabic\nscript reflects that it remained more popular among the Muslims of India. During the\nperiod of the Sultanate of Delhi (1206-1526), such major poets as Amir Khusrau\n(1253-1325), Quli Qutub Shah and Wali Deccani all composed high quality Urdu\nverse. Then, during the Mughal rule it was greatly patronized by the Mughal Court.\nWith the passage of time, it began to replace Persian. During the 18th and 19th\ncenturies several Urdu poets became prominent like Mir Dard, Sauda, Momin, Zauq,\nand the last Mughal king Bahadur Shah Zafar. The Aligarh Movement produced many\ngood poets and writers like Hali and Shibli.\nAnother important reason was Urdu’s close association with the Pakistan Movement.\nSir Syed had defended Urdu as the cultural identity of Muslims when Hindus in 1867,\ndemanded that Hindi should be made the official language of India. When Muslim\nLeague was formed in 1906, its objectives also included protection and promotion of\nUrdu. In the 1930’s the Muslim League began to consider that Urdu as its official\nlanguage. In 1937, the Muslim League to make all efforts possible to make Urdu their\nofficial language. Later in the 1940’s Urdu newspapers highlighted the cause of the\nPakistan Movement and the activities of its leaders.\nIt may be concluded that Urdu was declared as the national language primarily to\nfoster a sense of national unity because language is one of the strongest marks of\ncultural identity of any nation, and since the creation of Pakistan was a new\nexperience for its people, they needed to realise that they had their own distinct\nidentity as a nation.\n\n\nQ: How has the Pakistan government promoted the development of\nUrdu between 1947 and 1999? [4]\nAns.\nUrdu was declared as the national language of Pakistan. It was made the medium of\neducation in educational institutes of the public and private sector. Special awards were\noffered to the best writings in prose and poetry by the government. Most of the programs,\nplays and news are broadcast on radio and TV in Urdu. Federal Ministry of Information has\nbeen issuing the monthly “Mah-i-Nau” from Lahore, and a quarterly “Adabiyat” is issued by\nthe Academy of Letters, Islamabad.\nQ: Why have regional languages been promoted by the Pakistani\ngovernment between 1947 and 1999? (7)\nAns. Regional languages form the basis of cultural identity of Pakistan along with Urdu.\nWith the declaration of Urdu as the national language, government decided to\npromote regional languages, too. Sindhi, among all regional languages, was the first\nto have adopted the Arabic script. This reflects its close association with Islam.\nSeveral sufi poets, such as Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai and Sachal Sarmast wrote Sindhi\nverse. Therefore, it was important to promote it. After 1947, many institutes were set\nup to promote Sindhi. They include Sachal Sarmast Academy and the Department of\nSindhology in the University of Sindh.\nPashto is spoken in Khyber Pakhtoon Khwa (former NWFP) and its literature carries\na strong element of resistance against the foreign rule. Such an element of resistance\nis quite visible in the poetry of Khushhal Khan Khattak and Rehman Baba. This way\nPashto became associated with the Pakistan movement. Therefore, after\nindependence, Islamia College Peshawar and University of Peshawar contributed to\nthe development of Pashto.\nBalochi is spoken in the largest province in terms of its area but..."

          "question": "'Partition or reversal?' Were the reasons why Bengal was\npartitioned in 1905 more important than those regarding its\nreversal in 1911? Explain your answer. (14)",
          "answer": "Reasons for the partition of Bengal were very important. Bengal was a province with\na huge population spread over a small area. There was Hindu majority in the\nwestern, and Muslim majority in the eastern part. The British thought it wise to divide\nBengal along communal lines in such a way that East Bengal would become a new\nprovince with a Muslim majority, and West Bengal with a Hindu majority.\nBengal was also divided due to administrative reasons as it was difficult to govern\nby a single governor. With two governors ruling two provinces, it became easier to\ncollect revenue and to maintain law and order in a highly populated province. As a\nresult of partition, Muslims felt greatly relieved as they became a majority in the\nnewly created province of East Bengal and Assam where they could prosper by\nmaking their own government. The partition also affected the Hindu monopoly on\ntrade, economy and politics of Bengal as Muslim began to develop the Chittagong\nport to compete with the Calcutta port in west Bengal. Hindus, therefore, considered\nthe partition as another example of the British policy of \"divide and rule\", because it\nhelped British establish their rule over India more firmly. Hindus also believed that\npartition was aimed at striking at the roots of Indian nationalism and unity. Partition\nhad divided the province into two units with a distinct religious majority in each unit.\nThe INC considered all people living in Bengal only as Bengalis regardless of their\nreligious identity. So, the Hindus reacted violently.\nAs for the reversal of partition, it mainly came about as a result of the ever\ngrowing Hindu pressure on the British. The Hindu-dominated INC organized a\ncountry wide anti-partition campaign. Regular protests and strikes were held, and\nboycott of British goods, titles and institutes was organized on a large scale. They\nrejected the partition by linking it with the British strategy of dividing Indians into\nsub-groups and creating communal differences.\nThe Hindu anger was further reflected in the Swadeshi movement. In this a\nboycott of British goods was observed. At many places, the British factory made\ncotton cloth was thrown in the bonfire and this caused a significant drop in the sale\nof British goods. Gradually, the movement adopted terrorist activities when an\nattempt was made to assassinate Lord Minto. British goods and institutes were\nboycotted as a token of protest over the partition. Though the Muslims were assured\nof the irreversibility of the partition, the circumstances forced the British to\nreconsider this administrative decision. Pressure grew with time as all these\nactivities were paralyzing the state machinery and there was a visible threat to the\nBritish prestige and power in India. The British, therefore, annulled the partition in\nDecember 1911 in the Delhi Darbar and the announcement was made by King\nGeorge V himself.\nWhen analyzed objectively, it can be concluded that the reasons for partition of\nBengal were more important because the Muslim community began to develop a\nsense of \"distinct identity\" of their own, and also because they were alerted of the\npossible consequences of a Hindu-dominated India. The partition gave a hint to the\nMuslims about partition of India along communal lines.\nHow successful was the 1905 Partition of Bengal? Explain your answer.\n[14]",

It\nbelieved that all people living in India were primarily Indians regardless of the cultural\nand religious differences and identities. So, all communities living in Bengal were\nequally Indians whether they were Hindus or Muslims. It viewed the whole country as\n“mother India” and therefore, condemned the partition of Bengal as a kind of\nvivisection of their motherland. It declared 16th Oct 1905 as a day of mourning.\nThe Hindu dominated INC was also unhappy over the loss of monopoly over the\neconomy and politics of Bengal. In East Bengal, Muslims were a decisive majority and\nhad formed their own government. Therefore, their economic condition began to\nimprove. They decided to develop the Chittagong port in order to compete with the\nCalcutta port of West Bengal. All this scenario was worrying for the INC who launched\nan aggressive campaign against the British.\nQ How did British react to the Hindu protest against the partition of\nBengal? (7)\nAns.\nThe British took many quick measures to deal with the Hindu protest. They placed\nrestrictions on newspapers and public meetings. Between 1906 and 1908 several\neditors were arrested, trialed and imprisoned for writing articles against the British\npolicies. The Press Act of 1908 gave more powers to the government to restrict\nfreedom of expression and media. Between 1905 and 1909 thousands people were\narrested and jailed. The Government grants to schools and colleges participating in\nthe Swadeshi Movement were discontinued.\nMr Tilak was arrested in June 1908, and after a speedy trial, was given six years’\nimprisonment. Many radical leaders left India in these circumstances as jails were\nfilled with those the British considered as revolutionaries. The British themselves\ndeported many suspects without framing them in a case or conduting a trial against\nthem.\nThe British got worried over the growing protest by the Hindu-led INC. They realized\nthat use of force against Hindus would not be sufficient. Therefore, they decided to\nwin the support of the moderate Hindus by drafting new constitutional reforms. The\nViceroy Lord Minto worked with the Secretary of State of India, John Morley. Finally,\nthe Indian Council’s Act 1909/ the Morley-Minto Reforms were introduced to win the\nsupport of the Hindu community.\nQ Why was partition of Bengal reversed? (7)\nAns. The INC fully pressurized the British government to reconsider the decision of\npartition. A country-wide anti-partition campaign was launched. Mob rallies were\norganized and shutter down strikes were observed as a token of resentment against\nthe partition. With the passage of time, the opposition to the partition became fierce\nand eventually adopted the terrorist behavior. Many senior British officials were\n\n\nattacked including Lord Minto who survived a murder attempt. This created a serious\nproblem for the British as they found it difficult to run the state affairs effectively.\nThe INC started the Swadeshi Movement in which boycott of the British goods and\ninstitutions was observed. British titles given to the Hindus were returned and the\nattendance in various institutes dropped significantly. At many places, the British\nfactory made cotton cloth was thrown in the bonfire to mark the hatred against the\nVideshi/foreign goods. This created serious economic difficulties for the British as the\nsale of their products sharply declined in the Indian markets.\nKing George V was scheduled to visit India in 1911. The INC, threatened to boycott\nthe Coronation ceremony of the King that was a royal tradition and a hallmark of\nBritish authority over its colonies. This threat of the INC was a serious blow to the\npride and prestige of the British who were now pressurized to reconsider the partition.\nSir John Jenkins, a member of the Viceroy’s executive council, advised the British\ngovernment to reverse the partition and the King himself announced the reversal in\nDelhi in 1911. Assam, Bihar and Orissa were separated from reunited Bengal.\n\n\nQ: 'Partition or reversal?' Were the reasons why Bengal was\npartitioned in 1905 more important than those regarding its\nreversal in 1911? Explain your answer. (14)\nAns. Reasons for the partition of Bengal were very important. Bengal was a province with\na huge population spread over a small area. There was Hindu majority in the\nwestern, and Muslim majority in the eastern part. The British thought it wise to divide\nBengal along communal lines in such a way that East Bengal would become a new\nprovince with a Muslim maj..."

      "raw_text": "\nQ: What was the Indian Councils Act 1909/The Morley-Minto\nReforms? [4]\nAns.\nThey were jointly drafted by the Viceroy Lord Minto, and the Secretary of State for\nIndia John Morley. Under these all the councils were enlarged. The Imperial Council now had\n60 members, and 60 new members were added to the Central Executive Council. Provincial\nCouncils were increased to 50 members in the larger and 30 in the smaller provinces. The\ncouncils, however, could not make, amend or annul any law but could only advise the\ngovernment on important matters. Muslims were given the right of separate electorate and,\ntherefore, the INC opposed the reforms.\nQ: Why were the Morley-Minto reforms of 1909 opposed by the INC?\n(7)\nAns.\nThe INC was disappointed by the reforms. The reforms gave nominal powers to the\ncentral and provincial legislative councils. They could not make, change or annul any of the\nlaws. Instead, the members could only ask questions on important matters express their\nopinions or advise the government respectfully. This went against the INC policy of making a\ndemand for self-rule in India.\nThe INC also wanted a greater increase in the size of the councils at all levels so that\na greater number of Indians could make way to the power corridor. The British knew all this\nand therefore, they increased the size of the councils according to their own policies as they\nwere in no mood to raise the legislative councils to the status of a parliament or establish a\ndemocracy in India as can be seen from the remarks of John Morley, “I for one would have\nnothing to do with it (democracy/parliament).”\nThe INC sharply criticized the granting of separate electorate to the Muslims. It was\nunhappy on Muslims getting a relatively higher position in the councils despite their much\nsmaller numbers. The INC declared this an undemocratic step because such a special\nconcession to Muslims directly threatened the Hindu dominance in Indian politics.\nSource A: criticism on the separate electorates for Muslims , from an\nInternet link :\nhttps://m.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/amp/indian-council-act-of-1909-\nmorley-minto-reforms-main-features-1443011546-1\n“By granting separate electorates to Muslims, the British hoped to cut off\nMuslims from the nationalist movement by treating them apart from the rest of the\nnation. They told the Muslims that their interests were separate from those of other\nIndians. To weaken the nationalist movement, the British began to consistently follow\na policy of communalism in India.”\nQ. (a) What does Source A tell us about the British aims in 1909? [3]\nAns.\n\n\nThe basic aim of the British was to keep Muslims from the nationalist. They\nconvinced Muslims that their political interests were distinct from the rest of Indians.\nThis was part of the British policy of communalism in India.\nSource B: a photograph regarding the Indian Councils Act, 1909.\nQ. (b) From Source B what message do we get about the Indian Councils\nAct, 1909? [5]\nAns.\nThe photograph shows the insignia of the British Parliament more prominently\nthan the tricolour Congress flag. This conveys a message of the British dominance in\nIndia as all legislation about India was made by the British Parliament. The Congress\nflag represents the British awareness about the Indian reaction and political interests.\nPlace of the flag shows that the British did not consult the Indians while introducing\nthe Morley-Minto reforms as the British at that time could not grant any political\nfreedom to the Indians. Congress criticised the Act sharply as it wanted more powers\nfor the Council members, and was opposed to the separate electorates for Muslims.\nRevolutionary attempts in India during the WW1\nQ: What was the Silk Letter Movement/Conspiracy? [4]\nAns:\nIt was a revolutionary movement launched by the Deobandi sect of Sunni Muslims in\nIndia from 1913 to 1920.It’s aim was to liberate India from the British rule with the help of\nGermany, the Ottoman Turkey and Afghanistan. The Punjab CID uncovered the conspiracy\nby capturing letters written by Maulana Ubaid Ullah Sindhi to Maulana Mahmud Ul Hassan.\nThese letters were written in silk cloth, hence the name “Silk Letters Conspiracy”. Both the\nleaders visited Afghanistan and persuaded the Afghan Amir to initiate an insurrection in the\ntribal belt of India. However, like many other similar secret attempts, this too was foiled by\nthe British.\nRelations b/w Muslims & British before the\nWWI (First World War)\n 1911, reversal of partition of Bengal affected the relations because:\n\n\n Muslims took it as a betrayal of the British promises & reassurance to the Muslims\nthat the partition was final\n They lost faith in British → they didn't expect any real political power to be given\nto them by the British\n Their frustration was reinforced when they saw the M.M.

The British had failed to grant more rights to the Indians in the period upto\n1914. Instead, the British policy of repression during the WW1 also brought the two parties\ncloser to each other. Therefore, both parties set up joint councils to improve common\nunderstanding on key issues. So, both decided to cooperate with each other in order to\ngenerate feelings of goodwill and friendship.\nML and INC also wanted to reduce mutual friction and to accommodate each other.\nThe main figure in this regard was Mr. Muhammad Ali Jinnah who believed in a unity between\nthe INC and the ML. He was, therefore, given the title of the ‘ambassador of Hindu-Muslim\nunity’ by Mr. Gokhle. Thus, the INC and the ML held a joint session in Lucknow.

          "answer": "The Montague-Chelmsford reforms (M.C reforms) were jointly drafted by John\nMontague, Secretary of State of India, and Lord Chelmsford, the Viceroy. They\nbecame operative in 1919. They enlarged the size of the legislative councils,\nincreased the number of voters to 5.5 million and granted the right of separate\nelectorate to Sikhs, too.\nIn the Centre, a bicameral set up was introduced with an upper house, the Council of\nState and a lower house the legislative assembly. The Council of State had 60 seats,\n33 of whom were elected. The Legislative Assembly had 145 members, with 103\nbeing elected for a period of 3 years. These 103 included 32 Muslims. A Council of\nPrinces was setup with 108 members where Princes could debate important topics.\nAt provincial level, Diarchy was introduced. In this, subjects were divided between the\n\n\ngovernor (reserved subjects) and ministers (transferred subjects). Enlargement of the\ncouncils, increased number of voters and protection of minorities were welcomed.\nThe real powers were, however, still with the British, as the Viceroy could pass any\nlaw he liked in the Centre. Governors of the provinces, likewise, could veto any law\nthey disliked. The Council of Princes, too, didn’t have powers and eventually it\nbecame a kind of a ‘talking shop’.\nTo make things worse, the Rowlatt Act was enforced. It gave powers to the police to\narrest anyone without warrant and detain him without the right of bail. The Act led to\nthe tragic Amritsar massacre.\nHowever, some other political developments also took place during the same time\nperiod. Before the 1919 Act, the British had introduced the Indian Councils Act 1909,\nalso known as the Morley-Minto reforms (M.M. Reforms). Under this act, size of the\nprovincial and central legislative councils was increased: for larger provinces 50 and\nfor smaller provinces 30 members. The Imperial Council was increased to 60\nmembers by adding more non official members. Also, the Central Executive Council\nwas expanded by adding 60 new members, including many Indians. Muslims were\ngiven the right of separate electorates. The councils, however, had little powers. The\nmembers could ask questions and express their opinion and advise the government\non some issues. INC was not satisfied with these provisions and it sharply criticized\nthe provision of separate electorates for Muslims. For INC, it was an undemocratic\nconcession, but for Muslim League, it was recognition of their political importance.\nThe Lucknow Pact of 1916 was an agreement between INC and Muslim League. Due\nto the efforts of Jinnah, ML and INC held their joint session at Qaiser Bagh Baradari,\nLucknow. INC was led by Ambeka Charan Mahajan and ML was represented by Mr.\nJinnah. Both parties agreed on a charter of common demands, called the Lucknow\nPact. The Pact asked the British for provincial autonomy, enlargement of the councils\nby including more Indians. A very important clause was the acceptance of separate\nMuslim electorates by the INC. It also agreed to give Muslims one-third seats in the\nCentre. The Lucknow Pack marked a great occasion of Hindu-Muslim unity. It also\nshowed the desire of self-rule among Indians, as there were two more Home Rule\nLeagues during the same period ---- one by Bal Ganga Dhar Tilak and the other by\nMrs. Annie Besant It, however, also reflected that Hindus would be ready to accept\nany degree of partition of India along communal lines in future.\nWith objective analysis, it seems that the Mont-ford reforms were the most important\npolitical development, because the introduction of Diarchy and bicameral set up\nshowed the British willingness to grant Indians more rights, though rather slowly.",

The right of separate electorates was extended to\nthe Sikhs, too. The number of voters was increased to 5.5 million. Both INC and ML\nopposed the reforms.\nQ: What was the Rowlatt Act? (4)\nAns. The British anticipated a violent reaction to the Mont-Ford reforms. They appointed\nan investigative committee under Justice Rowlatt in Dec. 1917. In the light of its report\nthe Rowlatt Act was passed in 1919. The Act empowered the local\nadministration/police to arrest anyone without warrant, detain him without the right of\nbail and decide where the people in a province should live. Gandhi launched a\ncountrywide strike against it, and Jinnah resigned from the Imperial Legislative\nCouncil in protest. A protest by 20,000 unarmed people led to the tragic massacre at\nJillianwala Bagh, a public park, in Amritsar, in April 1919.\nQ: Who was General Dyer? [4]\nAns.\nHe was a British commander, in charge of the police in Amritsar. He quickly mobilized\nhis troops against a huge number of Indians who had gathered in a public park,\nJallianwala Bagh. He thought the aim of these people was to protest against the\nRowlett Act. On 13th April 1919 he ordered a direct shoot out on the peaceful\ngathering. Hundreds of people were killed and several more injured. Dyer was trialed\nfor his cruel action and removed from his post.\nQ: Describe the Amritsar Massacre? (4)\nAns. As part of protest against the Rowlatt Act, there was unrest in Amritsar and five\nEuropeans were killed. An angry mob of 20,000 gathered in a public park, Jillianwala\nBagh.

Granting of separate electorates to Muslims was a major step towards the development\nof Muslim nationalism. The INC opposed this because it viewed this as an undemocratic step.\nThis supposition by the INC further alerted the Muslim community that was already upset\nover the Hindu reaction on the partition of Bengal.\nAs for the reversal of partition, it mainly came about as a result of the ever growing\nHindu pressure on the British. The Hindu-dominated INC organized a country wide anti-\npartition campaign. Regular protests and strikes were held, and boycott of British goods, titles\nand institutes was organized on a large scale. They rejected the partition by linking it with the\nBritish strategy of dividing Indians into sub-groups and creating communal differences. The\nHindu anger was further reflected in the Swadeshi movement. In this a boycott of British\ngoods was observed. At many places, the British factory made cotton cloth was thrown in the\nbonfire and this caused a significant drop in the sale of British goods.\nGradually, the movement adopted terrorist activities when an attempt was made to\nassassinate Lord Minto. British goods and institutes were boycotted as a token of protest\nover the partition. Though the Muslims were assured of the irreversibility of the partition, the\ncircumstances forced the British to reconsider this administrative decision. Pressure grew\nwith time as all these activities were paralyzing the state machinery and there was a visible\nthreat to the British prestige and power in India. The British, therefore, annulled the partition\nin December 1911 in the Delhi Darbar and the announcement was made by King George V\nhimself. The announcement shocked the Muslims who felt betrayed by the British. They felt\nthey could no longer trust either the INC or the British for the safeguarding of their political\ninterests. Therefore, soon on the advice of Jinnah, the ML would demand self rule instead of\nits earlier policy of promoting loyalty to the British.\nThe Lucknow Pact was signed between the ML and the INC in 1916.

          "answer": "The British had been closely watching the revolutionary activities in India during the\nWW1. After the War, they offered Indians some political concessions in the 1919 Act. They,\nhowever, were determined to strengthen their grip on India, and deal with those who opposed\nthe British rule. Accordingly, while drafting the 1919 Act, they appointed a committee in 1917\nunder Justice Rowlatt. The committee was assigned the task of investigating the\nrevolutionary activities in India. The committee declared in its report in April 1918 that there\nwas ample evidence of revolutionary attempts in India. It recommended extending strict laws\nin the Defence of India Act,1915 permanently to deal with such anti-British activities. These\nstrict laws included ,arresting any suspect without warrant and detaining the arrested person\nfor an indefinite period without granting him the right of bail. Moreover, they included such\nsteps as ‘juryless’ in camera trials , and empowered provincial government to ask residents\nof any area where to live.\nThese proposals angered the Indians a lot as they contradicted two of the central\nprinciples of the British justice system, namely trial by jury, and providing safeguards against\nillegal imprisonments. Jinnah resigned from the Imperial Legislative Council in protest, and\nGandhi immediately launched a campaign against the proposals. Throughout April 1919\nthere were strikes and demonstrations throughout India as the Indians rejected such\nunusually strict measures. The Viceroy Lord Chelmsford, however, remained firm , ignoring\nall protests. The report was presented as two bills in the British Parliament, and they were\ncalled “ Black Bills” by the Indian leadership. The Bills were passed and enforced as the\nRowlatt Act in 1919. He mishandled the situation by adopting more unpopular measures such\nas putting a ban on publishing anti-British articles.\nThe politically volatile situation resulting from the implementation of the Rowlatt Act\nworsened with time as the British were totally inflexible about it. They tried to restrict the\nIndian protests, and banned public meetings. Moreover, by early 1919, they deported two\nprominent nationalist leaders, Dr Satyapal and Dr Saif-ud- Din Kitchlew. The public unrest\ngained momentum especially in Punjab. On 10 April, large scale riots in Amritsar led to\nattacking two banks and killing of five Europeans. Violence escalated when the British\ncommander of the area, General Dyer banned all public meetings. The notice of this ban was\nnot publicised widely. So several Hindu and Sikh villagers primarily gathered to celebrate the\ntheir annual festival of Baisakhi in the public park. They also wanted a peaceful demonstration\nagainst the Act .\nDyer was angered when he was told about a crowd of 20,000 gathered at Jillianwala\nBagh, a public park in Amritsar on 13 April 1919. The park had a narrow entrance surrounded\nby a 5 foot wall. Dyer appointed his troops at the entrance, and ordered an immediate\nshootout without any warning. Around 1600 rounds were shot causing about 400 deaths of\nmen, women and children. Another people 1200 were wounded. Dyer justified his step by\nsaying he wanted the Indians to obey the British rule in all circumstances. He was\n\n\nreprimanded by the British government but the media defended his action. This further\nangered the Indians, and consequently violence grew more in India.\nThe viceroy Lord Chelmsford and the Secretary of State for India, Lord John\nMontague jointly drafted the Government of India Act 1919, also called Montford reforms.\nIndians had high hopes of some reward for their contribution in the WW1. Several Indians\nhad sacrificed their lives , and several others had returned without any compensation. The\n1919 Act enlarged the size of all legislative councils, now called assemblies.

The upper house was the Council of State , while\na Council of Princes was also set up. At the provincial level, Diarchy was introduced under\nwhich some powers of the governors were transferred to the ministers. However, the Viceroy\ncould pass any law he liked. Similarly, the provincial governor could declare emergency\nwithout consulting the ministers. Therefore, the reforms greatly disappointed the Indians who\nhad expected more powers for the elected members. Congress, in August 1918, declared\nthe Act as inadequate, unsatisfactory and disappointing. Moreover, granting the right of\nseparate electorate, earlier given to Muslims,to other minorities led to communal divide and\nthen communal violence in India. Extremists left the Congress, and this caused further\nviolence.\nIt may be concluded that the Rowlatt Act was the most important reason of violence\nas it negated fundamental human rights of the Indians, and weakened the British claims of\njustice for all.

However, after the War, through the\npeace treaties such as the Treaty of Sevres, it became evident that Britain and France\nwould punish Germany and abolish the Turkish Empire by dividing its slices among\nthe victors.\nThey had a special respect for the Turkish/Ottoman Empire as the Sultan of\nTurkey was also the spiritual head or Khalifa of the entire Muslim world. He was the\ncustodian of all the holy places of Islam in Arabia and other Middle Eastern states.\nTherefore, any punishment of Turkey meant an insult of the Khalifa and that\ntantamounted to hurting the religious sentiments of the Muslims. Therefore, in an\nattempt to maintain the respect and its Khalifa, the prominent religious leaders of\nIndia, like the Ali brothers, hastily organized the All-India Khilafat Conference in 1919.\nFinally the Indian Muslims had long been developing fears about the British\npolicy towards them not only in India but in other parts of the world, too. The governor\nof UP, Sir James Meston, ordered demolition of the eastern part of a mosque in\n\n\nKanpur as part of a project of widening a road in the city. A Hindu temple on the same\nroad was spared when Hindus pressurized the British government. This generated\nanger among Muslims as it reflected a disregard for the Muslim holy places by the\nBritish. Consequently many Indian Muslim leaders began to believe that British\nwanted to induce a fear of Hindus so that Muslims could be forced to cooperate with\nthe British wherever needed. For this reason, leaders like Maulana Abul Kalam Azad\nsharply criticized the Muslims who had joined the British army. Clash of views\nbetween Russia and Britain about governing Afghanistan and Persia (Iran) further\nadded to their worries as the two powers did not consider the feelings of the Muslim\npopulation of these states.",

          "question": "Why did the Khilafat Movement fail by 1924? (7)",
          "answer": "The Movement was not well organized. Gandhi had supported the Movement on the\ncondition of Ahimsa/non-violence while merging his non-cooperation movement of\nSwaraj/self-rule. However, the violence at Chauri-Chaura in 1922 forced him to\nwithdraw his support. About 22 policemen were burned alive by an angry mob that\nhad taken control of the Police station in this town of Gorakhpur district. Gandhi’s\nsupport had strengthened the Khilafat Movement significantly, and therefore, his\nwithdrawal proved fatal for it as it lost the support of the Hindu majority. Thus, trusting\nGandhi also reflected lack of political insight in the leaders of the Khilafat Movement.\nIn August 1920, about 18,000 Muslims left for Afghanistan after selling their properties\nand leaving their jobs after their leaders had declared India as Dar ul Harb/a land\nunder the enemy rule. They also promised them a bright future by asking them to\ncultivate the fertile lands in Afghanistan. However, most of these migrants were\npushed back by the people and the Government of Afghanistan as the country did not\nhave enough resources to accommodate a growing number of migrants. Many died\nduring the long journey and those who managed to reach back their homeland, faced\nserious economic problems as their homes and jobs had been occupied by others.\nThey lost enthusiasm in the movement and trust in the leaders.\nFinally, the last nail in the coffin of the Khilafat Movement was driven by the Turkish\nMilitary leader Kemal Attaturk (Mustafa Kemal Pasha). In 1922 under a military\nrevolution, Turkey became a republic and the last Khalifa Sultan Muhammad/Mehmet\nVI was deprived of political powers. Attaturk, in the meantime, had regained some of\nthe lost Turkish territories and forced the Allies for a new peace treaty, the Treaty of\nLausanne. This made him a hero in the eyes of the Turkish people. In 1924, the new\nTurkish Government led by Kemal Attaturk, abolished the institute of Khilafat and later\nsent the last Khalifa into exile. This proved to be a decisive blow to the Khilafat\nMovement since it showed that the Turks didn’t care for the struggle of the Indian\nMuslims. That is why some historians have described the Khilafat Movement, as a\nwrong ideology, romantic and out of touch with realities. The Indian Muslims were\ngreatly disillusioned by this act of a fellow Turkish Muslim and it sealed the fate of the\nKhilafat Movement.",

          "question": "The Khilafat Movement (KM) was founded mainly due to the deep\nseated fears among the Muslims about the anti- Muslim British\npolicies. Explain why you might agree and disagree? (14)",
          "answer": "Muslims were suspicious of many of the British policies. Indian Muslims had\nbeen developing fears about the British policy towards Muslims not only in India but\nin other parts of the world. The governor of UP, Sir James Meston, ordered demolition\nof the eastern part of a mosque in Kanpur as part of a project of widening a road in\nthe city. A Hindu temple on the same road was spared when Hindus pressurized the\nBritish government. Many Muslims requested the governor not to demolish any part\nof the mosque but did not accept their request. This generated anger among Muslims\nas it reflected a disregard for the Muslim holy places by the British. Consequently\nmany Indian Muslim leaders began to believe that British wanted to induce a fear of\nHindus so that Muslims could be forced to cooperate with the British wherever\nneeded. For this reason, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad sharply criticized Muslims who\nhad “cooperated with the Satans of Europe”. As a result of such statements, there\nwere a large number of desertions by Muslim soldiers in the British army when they\nwere asked to fight against fellow Muslims in Turkey. The neighbouring Muslim states,\nAfghanistan and Persia (Iran) had been the subject of clash between Russia and\nBritain. Both powers agreed on the way the two Muslim states should be run without\nconsulting or considering the opinion of Muslim majority in the two states.\nTherefore when, the WWI ended. the British aims about the fate of Turkey became\npublic, prominent Muslim leaders in India did not hesitate in organizing a powerful\nKhalifat Movement whose aim was to save the sacred institute of Khalifat.\nRoots of KM are to be traced in the beginning and the end of WWI (World War One,\n1914 – 1918). Since Turkey had decided to support Germany in the War, the Indian\nMuslims felt themselves in a predicament as they developed a fear that Indian\nMuslims might be forced to fight against the Turkish Muslims if they were pitted\nagainst each other during the War. To this was added the fear of harsh treatment of\nTurkey by the British-led Allies in case of British victory. On the British reassurance\nthe Muslims soldiers decided to support the British army So they sought reassurance\nabout the respect of Turkey. After the war, the peace treaties of Versailles and Sevres\nunfolded the British plans of abolishing the Turkish empire alongwith punishing\nGermany and Austria. The Muslims felt disillusioned about the British promises and\nimmediately founded a Khalifat Committee to launch the KM.\nTurkey was not just the only Muslim empire in the World, it was also the last seat of\nthe institute of Khalifat for many centuries. Sultan of Turkey was the Khalifa (spiritual\nhead) of the Muslim world and in that capacity, he was custodian of the Holy places\nof Islam in Arabia and other parts of the Middle East. His name was pronounced in\nthe Friday sermons throughout the Muslim world as a token of respect for his dignified\nstatus. This was so because of the sanctity of institute of Khalifat since the days of\nthe Rightly Guided Caliphs (632 AD – 661AD and onwards). Thus Indian Muslims,\nlike Muslims of the other part of the world, had great respect for Turkey in general and\nthe Khalifa in particular. Therefore they felt themselves morally and religiously bound\nto make all out efforts to save the Khalifat.\nIn view of all these, we may conclude that the fear about the anti Muslim British\npolicies was the most important reason for the foundation of the KM because the\nIndian Muslims had started believing that the British were bent upon weakening the\nMuslims so that their imperial designs of ruling various parts of the world could be\neffectively materialized.",

          "question": "The Khilafat Movement failed because Gandhi withdrew his\nsupport. Do you agree? Give reasons for your answer. (14)",
          "answer": "Gandhi withdrew his support at a critical moment. Initially Gandhi had conditioned his\nsupport for the Khilafat Movement with Ahimsa (non-violence). When in February\n1922, an angry mob took control of a police station in the UP town of Chauri Chaura\nand burned 22 policemen alive, Gandhi reacted on this violent event and announced\nthe withdrawal of his support for the Khilafat Movement. It was a deadly blow to the\nmovement. Gandhi was perhaps using this movement in order to strengthen his\nSwaraj Movement. Now, just as Gandhi’s support was vital for the movement, his\nwithdrawal proved fatal because he had unified the two largest communities of India\n---- Hindus and Muslims. In the following years, violent communal clashes between\nthe Muslims and Hindus erupted which marred the Khilafat Movement, for example,\nthe Moplah uprising in Southern India.\nFailure of the Hijrat Movement also damaged the stability of the Khilafat Movement.\nIn 1920, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and other leaders declared India as Dar-ul-Harb\n(literally, “battle field” and, in Islamic Sharia, “a land under enemy/non Muslim rule).\nThey asked the Muslims to migrate to the nearest independent Muslim state\nAfghanistan. The exact figures aren’t known but it’s estimated that anywhere from\naround 15000 - 20000 Muslims resigned from their jobs, sold their properties and left\nfor Afghanistan. Many students left their studies and joined the migrant Muslims.\nThese Muslims had been promised a good future in Afghanistan where, by cultivating\nthe fertile lands, they could start a new phase of life. Unfortunately, these promises\nproved fake as Afghanistan was a resource-deficit country with a rugged landscape\nand without any fertile land. In the beginning the migrant Muslims were welcomed but\nas their number grew they were pushed back. Many were accommodated in\nPeshawar and neighbouring towns of modern day KPK but many died during the long\nand dangerous journey. Those who managed to get back to India found their jobs and\nhomes occupied. This Hijrat Movement brought economic disaster and miseries to\nthousands of Muslims and also damaged the creditability of the Khilafat leaders.\nIndian Muslims also realized that Muslims of others states were not as much\nconcerned about the Khilafat as they themselves had been.\nIn southern India the Muslim peasants of the Arab origin became violent in August,\n1921. They were enthusiastic religious Muslims, who were angry with both the\npowerful Hindu landlords as well as the British authorites. At Tirur nearly 10,000\nMoplahs destroyed the local police station and seized arms and ammunition. They\nalso damaged the Hindu property including temples. The British troops soon took\nstrict action as they killed more than 4,000 Moplahs and wounded several others. The\nBritish suffered around 100 casualties. The violence damaged the cause of the\nKhilafat Movement by dividing Muslims and Hindus in all parts of India. The Hindu\ncommunity gradually withdrew its support for the Khilafat Movement.\nFinally, the last nail in the coffin of the Khilafat Movement was driven by the\nTurkish Military leader Kemal Attaturk (Mustafa Kemal Pasha). In 1922 under a\nmilitary revolution, Turkey became a republic and the last Khalifa Sultan\nMuhammad/Mehmet VI was deprived of political powers. Attaturk, in the meantime,\nhad regained some of the lost Turkish terror ties and forced the Allies for a new peace\ntreaty, the Treaty of Lausanne.

It was held in Delhi in November 1919, led by the Ali brothers, Maulana Muhammad\nAli Johar and Maulana Shaukat Ali. They hoped to try and persuade the British to\nkeep their promises about maintaining the respect of the Turkish Empire. Maulana\nAbul Kalam Azad and Gandhi attended it as representatives of the INC. Gandhi hoped\nto keep Hindus and Muslims united in his non-violent campaign against the British.\nAzad warned the Conference that the British PM Lloyd George planned to punish\nTurkey for fighting against the British in the WW1. The Conference passed a\nresolution for sending a delegation to Britain to tell it about the strength of the Muslim\nsupport for the Khalifa and the institute of Khilafat.\nQ: What was the Khilafat Movement? (4)\nAns. It was started in 1919 by the Muslim religious leaders of India to save the respect of\nTurkey and the institute of Khilafat. Maulana Muhammad Ali Johar, Maulana Shaukat\nAli and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad were its major leaders. Gandhi merged his non-\ncooperation campaign with it. Three Khilafat Conferences were held, a delegation was\nsent to the British PM Lloyd George in February 1920 to persuade him for a fair\ntreatment of Turkey. Thousands of Muslims migrated to Afghanistan in the Hijrat\nMovement in 1920. Jinnah and the ML stayed away from it but supported the cause\nof the Khilafat Movement. The Movement ended in 1924 with the abolition of the\nKhilafat by Kemal Attaturk.\nQ: What was the Moplah uprising? (4)\nAns. It was a violent uprising by the Moplahs, Muslim peasants in South India during the\nKhilafat Movement. Their anger was against Hindu landowners and the British. In\nAugust 1921, nearly 10,000 Moplahs at Tirur destroyed the police station and seized\nall arms and also destroyed Hindu property including temples. The British troops\nreacted quickly and killed more than 4,000 Moplahs while several more were\nwounded. There were only 100 British casualties.\nQ: What was the Hijrat Movement? (4)\nAns. It was a religious move that was started by the Muslim leaders of the Khilafat\nMovement in August 1920. The leaders urged Muslims to leave Dar ul Harb, India,\nand migrate to the neighbouring Dar ul Islam, Afghanistan. Around 18000-20000\nMuslims migrated, selling their houses and leaving their jobs. They were promised a\nbetter future but the Afghan government refused to accommodate them. Many died\non their way back to India.\nQ. Who was Sultan Muhammad/Mehmet VI? [4]\nAns.\nHe was the last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire who ruled from July 1918-1922. His\ndecision to support Germany against Britain in the WW-I proved disasterous as\nTurkey lost control over Baghdad, Jerusalem and Constantinople (Istanbul). The\nOttoman Empire was abolished by the Allies under the treaty of Sevres, August 1920.\nAs he lost popularity, the Turkish Grand National Assembly under Kemat Attaturk\n\n\ndeposed the Sultan and sent him into exile to Italy. Attaturk abolished the Khilafat in\n1924. He died in May 1926 and was buried in Damacus.\nQ. What was the Chauri-Chaura incident? [4]\nAns.\nChaura-Chauri is a village in Gorakhpur district, UP. A violent incident took place there\nin February 1922 during the peak phase of the Khilafat Movement. An angry mob\nparticipating in the non-cooperation movement of Gandhi attacked the local police\nstation. The police opened fire, and in retaliation the mob set fire to the police station.\nThis resulted in burning alive of 22 policemen and killing of 3 civilians. Gandhi, who\nhad conditioned his support for non-coopertion movement with Ahimsa / Ahinsa or\nnon-violence, withdrew from the movement. This greatly weakened the Khilafat\nMovement.\nQ: What was Non-Cooperation Movemet?\n[4]\nAns.\nIt was primarily launched by Gandhi 1920 onwards, also followed by the Muslim\nleaders after Gandhi’s merger of non-cooperation with the Khilafat Movement. The\nthird and last Khilafat Conference was held in July 1921 in Delhi. The leaders of the\nmovement urged people to boycott British educational institutions, stop working in the\npolice or cooperating with the British in any other way. All major leaders of the Khilafat\nmovement were arrested after the conference. Muhammad Ali Jauhar was sentenced\nto two years’ imprisonment. His defiant statements during his trial made him a hero\namong the Muslims.\nQ: Why was the Khilafat Movement founded? (7)\nAns. The Indian Muslims wanted to keep the Khilafat alive. Turkey’s decision to\nsupport Germany in the WW1 had put the Indian Muslims in a predicament as they\nfeared harsh treatment of Turkey in case of the defeat of Germany. They, therefore,\nhad conveyed their reservations to the British in the beginning of the War.

However, after the Khilafat Movement, the communal violence in India\nbecame so serious by 1927 that it threatened any cooperation between Hindus and\nMuslims. Major Indian parties had already rejected the 1919 Act and wanted fresh\npolitical reforms. The Indians wanted a greater degree of provincial autonomy by\nabolishing the confusing clause of Diarchy of the 1919 Act. The Conservative\nGovernment, therefore, decided to advance the date of reviewing the 1919 Act by two\nyears.\nMoreover, Lord Birkenhead, the Secretary of State for India feared a defeat of\nthe Conservative Party in the upcoming elections, and thought that the Labour Party\nmight grant too many political concessions to the Indians. The ruling Consertive Party\ngovernment usually was not in favour of accepting most of the demands of the\nIndians. The Labour Party, on the other hand, was usually viewed relatively as more\nsympathetic towards the Indian question.\nTherefore, the Conservative Government constituted a committee of seven\nmembers of the British Parliament under Sir John Simon in 1927.

They appointed an advisory body i.e. Simon\nCommission to advise about future constitution of India.\n Conservative party government feared loss to labour party who could grant too many\nconcessions to India.\n So, a seven member commission was sent under Sir John Simon which reached India\nin early 1928.\nPROCEEDING:\n S.C. was opposed by major parties in India as it was “an all white body” as no Indian\nincluded; it was greeted by the slogans like “Uninvited guest of India, go back.”\n However, S.C. completed its work that was published in 1930 in two volumes.\n S.C. report was rejected by INC as well as ML as its contents didn’t satisfy either.\nQ: What were the Delhi Proposals? [4]\nAns.\nIn the wake of growing communal violence, Jinnah organized an All\nMuslim Party Conference, on March 20, 1927, in Delhi. He presided over\nthe session. It was aimed at safeguarding the political rights of the\nMuslims while attempting to improve relations with the Congress. The\nproposals included: making Sindh an independent province, political\nreforms in the NWF and Balochistan to grant them provincial status and\none third seats for Muslims in the Central Legislative Assembly. The ML\nwould drop its demand for separate Muslim electorates on the\nacceptance of these proposals. These would later become part of\nJinnah’s fourteen points.\nQ: What was the Simon Commission Report? [4]\nAns. The Conservative government sent a constitutional commission of seven members\nheaded by Sir John Simon in 1927. The Simon Commission prepared a report amidst\nopposition by the major Indian political parties. It recommended a federal form of\ngovernment for India, abolition of diarchy and separate electorates for Muslims but no\none third Muslim seats in the government it also opposed making Sindh and the NWF\nas provinces. INC and ML rejected it and the Nehru Report was prepared in its\nresponse in 1928.\nQ: Why was the Simon Commission sent to India? [7]\n\n\nAns. While introducing the 1919 Act the British had promised to review the Act after\nten years. However, after the Khilafat Movement, the communal violence in India\nbecame so serious by 1927 that it threatened any cooperation between Hindus and\nMuslims. Major Indian parties had already rejected the 1919 Act and wanted fresh\npolitical reforms. The Indians wanted a greater degree of provincial autonomy by\nabolishing the confusing clause of Diarchy of the 1919 Act. The Conservative\nGovernment, therefore, decided to advance the date of reviewing the 1919 Act by two\nyears.\nMoreover, Lord Birkenhead, the Secretary of State for India feared a defeat of\nthe Conservative Party in the upcoming elections, and thought that the Labour Party\nmight grant too many political concessions to the Indians. The ruling Consertive Party\ngovernment usually was not in favour of accepting most of the demands of the\nIndians. The Labour Party, on the other hand, was usually viewed relatively as more\nsympathetic towards the Indian question.\nTherefore, the Conservative Government constituted a committee of seven\nmembers of the British Parliament under Sir John Simon in 1927. It also included\nClement Attlee of the Labour Party, who would become committed to Indian\nindependence in 1934. The Simon Commission reached India by the start of 1928\nand prepared a set of proposals for the future constitution of India. The report was,\nhowever, rejected by the major political parties of India.\nQ: Why was the Simon Commission Report rejected? [7]\nAns.\nThe Simon Commission Report did not satisfy the major political parties of India. In\nfact, all the seven members of the Commission were British. The INC and the ML,\ntherefore, rejected the team by declaring it an “all white body”. The Indians wanted\ntheir participation in the process of making the future constitution for India but Lord\nBirkenhead had predicted the disunity among Indians would foil all efforts of the\nCommission. So, all major political parties of India took it as an insult to their self\nrespect, and rejected the Commission and its report.\nIn February 1928, the Commission was confronted by several protesters in\nPondicherry. Similar portests were organised in several other cities. A strike began,\nand many people turned out to greet the Commission with black flags. A prominent\nIndian nationalist Lala Lajpat Rai led a huge protest in Lahore. He was beaten by the\npolice very harshly, and died of the engeries in November 1928.\nThe recommendations of the Report failed to satisfy the major political parties\nbecause they were not acceptable to either the INC or the ML in totality. The INC\nwanted a federal form of government with most of the powers with the Centre whereas\nthe ML wanted a weak Central government with a greater degree of provincial\nautonomy. The ML also was disappointed as the Report recommended separate\n..."

          "question": "The Lucknow Pact of 1916 was the only beacon of hope for Hindu-\nMuslim Unity between 1914 and 1930. Do you agree? [14]",
          "answer": "The Lucknow Pact was signed in 1916. In 1913, the Muslim League added self-rule\nto its demands on the advice of Jinnah, and it shared a common ground with INC. In 1916,\nboth parties held their annual sessions jointly in Lucknow. Due to the support of Jinnah from\nthe League and Mahajan from the Congress, the Lucknow Pact was drawn up. The Congress\nagreed for separate Muslims electorates and 1/3rd Muslim seats in the Centre. There would\nbe a protection of minorities and all provinces would have provincial autonomy. No law could\nbe passed if 3/4th of the members did not support it. The pact was a move towards self-rule\nand brought the Muslims and Hindus together for the first time in a cordial atmosphere. The\nMuslim rights were protected and this way the INC showed an accommodative attitude\ntowards Muslims. The pact was high water walk for Hindu Muslim unity.\nIn 1909, the Morley-Minto reforms had promised more governing powers to the\nIndians. Therefore, in 1919, the Montague-Chelsmford reforms gave some more powers and\nshare in the councils/assemblies to the Indians. They proposed a system of two houses for\nthe Central Legislature. It introduced a system of ‘Diarchy’ in provinces. According to this, the\n‘transferred’ subjects (education, healthcare and agriculture) were to be given to the Indians\nand ‘reserved’ subjects (finance, law, justice and foreign relations) were left with the\ngovernors. Although the number of voters increased, the system was discriminatory. The\nreforms disappointed both the League and Congress and both still did not have substantial\npower. Hence, the Mont-Ford Reforms kept the Hindus and Muslims together as both had\nopposed them.\nThe Khilafat Movement, 1919-1924, also brought Muslims and Hindus on one\nplatform after Gandhi’s decision to support Muslims through his non-cooperation movement.\nThe ML, however, did not support the Khilafat Movement practically. Moreover, there were\nincidents of Hindu-Muslims riots after Gandhi withdrew his support following the violent\nincident Chaura Chauri.\nIn May 1928, members of all the political parties met in an All-Party Conference to\ndraft the constitution, which the INC thought could govern India. It was drawn up by Pundit\nMotilal Nehru in September 1928 and was called the Nehru report. It included demand for\nimmediate dominion status for India; a two chamber-parliament; the protection of minorities\nthrough a system of reserving seats but no 1/3rd seats for Muslims and no separate Muslim\nelectorates. It also recommended federal form of government but with a strong centre and\nlimited provincial autonomy. The recommendations of the Nehru report were a\ndisappointment for the Muslims as they asked for too many sacrifices from them. The three\nmain points, including the introduction of Hindi as a National Language were against the\nMuslims. Therefore, Jinnah commented on it by saying that it marked “parting of the ways”.\nIn 1929, Jinnah put forward the 14 points in an answer to the Nehru report. Before\nthese 14 points, he had proposed 3 very reasonable amendments to the Nehru Report. These\npoints were introduced to protect the political rights of Muslims. In the 14 points Jinnah\ndemanded for the federal form of government, provincial autonomy, Muslims representation\nby 1/3 seats in all cabinets and no law about a community to be approved without 3/4th\nmembers of the same community in the legislative assembly approving it. These 14 points\nwere opposed by the Congress, because they clearly reflected the political aspirations of the\nMuslims. Thus it was an occasion of failed Hindu-Muslim relations though Jinnah still believed\nin joint struggle.\n\n\nHence, it can be concluded that Lucknow pact was the only beacon of hope. Not only\ndid it unite Muslims and Hindus in 1916, it demonstrated the possibility of a united front\nagainst the British by the two largest communities of India. Such a spirit would never be seen\nagain in future.",

Since the 14 points were presented shortly after the rejection of the Nehru\nReport, it was evident that the gulf between Hindus and Muslims was getting unbridgeable.\nThis meant that events would be moving towards a separatist movement as the 14 points\ncontained so many demands for the safety of the Muslims.\nThis way, they would eventually become the basis of the demand of Pakistan in 1940\nby the ML. Jinnah had tried his best to work together with the INC but its leadership always\nadopted an uncompromising attitude. While unfolding these points in January 1929, Jinnah\nhad adopted a threatening tone by saying, “No scheme for the constitution of the Government\nof India will be acceptable unless all the following basic principles are given effect to.” Thus,\nthese fourteen points became an essential part of the manifesto/objectives of ML.\n\n\nQ: The Lucknow Pact of 1916 was the only beacon of hope for Hindu-\nMuslim Unity between 1914 and 1930. Do you agree? [14]\nAns.\nThe Lucknow Pact was signed in 1916. In 1913, the Muslim League added self-rule\nto its demands on the advice of Jinnah, and it shared a common ground with INC. In 1916,\nboth parties held their annual sessions jointly in Lucknow. Due to the support of Jinnah from\nthe League and Mahajan from the Congress, the Lucknow Pact was drawn up. The Congress\nagreed for separate Muslims electorates and 1/3rd Muslim seats in the Centre. There would\nbe a protection of minorities and all provinces would have provincial autonomy. No law could\nbe passed if 3/4th of the members did not support it. The pact was a move towards self-rule\nand brought the Muslims and Hindus together for the first time in a cordial atmosphere. The\nMuslim rights were protected and this way the INC showed an accommodative attitude\ntowards Muslims. The pact was high water walk for Hindu Muslim unity.\nIn 1909, the Morley-Minto reforms had promised more governing powers to the\nIndians. Therefore, in 1919, the Montague-Chelsmford reforms gave some more powers and\nshare in the councils/assemblies to the Indians. They proposed a system of two houses for\nthe Central Legislature. It introduced a system of ‘Diarchy’ in provinces. According to this, the\n‘transferred’ subjects (education, healthcare and agriculture) were to be given to the Indians\nand ‘reserved’ subjects (finance, law, justice and foreign relations) were left with the\ngovernors. Although the number of voters increased, the system was discriminatory. The\nreforms disappointed both the League and Congress and both still did not have substantial\npower. Hence, the Mont-Ford Reforms kept the Hindus and Muslims together as both had\nopposed them.\nThe Khilafat Movement, 1919-1924, also brought Muslims and Hindus on one\nplatform after Gandhi’s decision to sup..."

          "answer": "The RTC’s were held in London. The first RTC was held in November 1930 at the\nHouse of Parliament London. It was attended by 89 delegates including Mr. Jinnah\nand Sir Aga Khan. The purpose was to review the Simon Commission Report. The\nRTC was successful because federal form of government for India was approved and\nthe state princes promised to join the federation of India on the condition of protection\nof their rights. However, its main failure was the absence of INC as Gandhi was in jail\nfor his non-cooperation movement. INC wanted a guarantee of implementing\neverything agreed in the RTC such a guarantee could not be given. In the absence of\nINC no major decision could be reached. Also, there was no significant progress on\nthe details of the federal form of government and the reservations of the princely\nstates.\nIn order to include the INC, Lord Irwin met Gandhi in jail to persuade him to cooperate\nwith the British. Both reached an agreement, the Gandhi–Irwin Pact, signed in March\n1931 under which Gandhi called off his non-cooperation movement and was allowed\nto attend the Second RTC that was held in September - December 1931. It was\nsuccessful in the sense that all important political parties and leaders attended it. They\nincluded, Jinnah, Iqbal, Sir Aga Khan, Gandhi and state princes. Also three new\nprovinces were created, Orissa, Sindh and the NWFP/KPK. Diarchy was shifted from\nprovinces to the Centre. However, the RTC had failures too. Firstly the deadlock\nbetween Gandhi and Jinnah over the question of rights of minorities. Gandhi refused\nto provide any special protection to minorities and suggested that religious liberty was\nsufficient for them. He also insisted that the INC alone represented all Indians. Jinnah\nand other Muslim leaders were infuriated over the stubborn attitude of Gandhi.\nAnother failure was the replacement of Labour Government by a national government\ndominated by Conservative party that was not very much concerned about the RTC.\nInstead the British want that if Indians did not reach a consensus, the British would\nimpose their own terms.\nBefore the third RTC the British PM Ramsay MacDonald, announced the communal\naward in 1932. This was about the representation of minorities. INC rejected it but ML\naccepted it though the Muslim majority in Punjab and Bengal was reduced. The third\nRTC was held in November 1932 but was attended by only 46 delegates with Muslims\nbeing represented by Sir Aga Khan and Iqbal. The only success of the third RTC was\nthat it was held against all odds and that it was attended by some delegates including\nthe Muslims. The failures of this RTC therefore outnumbered the successes. Gandhi\nhad started his non-cooperation movement once again and was jailed. Jinnah had\nquit politics temporarily to start his law practice in London. Interestingly, he was not\neven invited to attend the RTC, but he did not miss much.\nIn the final analysis, it may be concluded that the three RTC’s were on the whole\nsuccessful because they provided a neutral venue to all the Indian leaders to discuss\nthe future constitution of India. Also, based on the proceedings of the RTC’s, the\ngovernment of India Act 1935 was implemented which was a very comprehensive\ndocument as both Pakistan and India made their constitutions to a great extent on the\nbasis of the same.\n\n\n1935 Act\nThe Govt of India Act 1935\n Details of RTC’s & proposals of British govt were published as a “White Paper”, March\n1933.\n Discussed and approved by British parliament, Dec 1934\n Aug 1935, the Bill became Govt of India Act 1935.\nContents:\n India to be a federation (federal form of govt) with Brit Indian provinces + states willing\nto join it\n Two houses of parliament (bicameral set up) with an upper housp (Council of State)\n& lower house (Legislative Assembly).\n Elected members from provinces, nominated from states\n Some reserved subjects with Viceroy (e.g. defence, foreign affairs etc), others with\nthe provincial administration\n Diarchy shifted from provinces to the centre; greater degree of provincial autonomy.\n 3 new provinces: Sindh, NWFP & Orissa\n Viceroy (Governor General) head of federation with special powers; governors also\nhad special powers – could dismiss provincial govt & declare emergency.\n No. of voters increased; 25% of total population.\n The part related to the central govt was never implemented because of rejection by\nprinces.\nIndian Reaction\n ML & INC rejected & criticized the Act\n Nehru: “Charter of Slavery” ; “ a machine with strong brakes but without an engine”\n Jinnah: “thoroughly rotten, fundamentally bad & totally unacceptable”.\n State princes resented loss of power the Act would entail\n Apparently, greater share & powers for Indians, real powers were still with the British\ne.g. Viceroy & governors could use emergency powers.\n Property qualification restricted the number of voters so, only 25% of total population\ncould vote.\nImportance of the Act\n An important step towards independence as it became the basis for future\nnegotiations that would pave the way for the British departure.\n Federal & palimentary system ensured greater Indian powers & representation in\ngovt.\n 3 new provinces, out of which 2 were Muslim majority – good for Muslims.",

          "answer": "The Government of India Act 1935 was the last major legislation that the British\ngovernment passed before independence was granted. It was very important because\nFederal form of government and a kind of parliamentary system meant that British\nwere pressurized to grant India self rule. The provincial governments were, to a great\nextent self governing units except for the emergency powers of the Governors and\nthe Viceroy. The Central Assembly and the Council of States were greatly enlarged\nby including more Indians.\nA 5 times increase in the number of voters ensured that more Indians, 25% of total\npopulation including 5 million women, had the right to elect their own representatives\nas compared to the previous number of voters, though 3/4th of the total population\nwas still deprived of this right. This increase was, however, strengthened by the\ncreation of three new provinces – Sindh, the NWFP, (both Muslim majority provinces)\nand Orissa. Thus an increase in the number of provinces was coupled with increased\ndegree of provincial autonomy. Thus India was seen to be nearing independence.\nThis Act laid the basis of future negotiations between the Indians and the British and\nthus paved the way for India eventually getting decolonized from the British rule. The\nPrinces States could decide to participate in political affairs for the first time.

He began a strike of Maran Bharatt (fasting unto death).\n\n\nQ Why was the Second Round Table Conference of 1931\nunsuccessful?\n[7]\nAns. The second conference was held from September – December 1931. Gandhi was\nable to attend the RTC as a result of the Gandhi – Irwin Pact of March 1931. Muslims\nwere represented by Sir Aga Khan, Allama Iqbal and Jinnah. During the talks Gandhi\nadopted a very rigid and inflexible attitude regarding the issue of minorities in India.\nHe insisted that religious liberty was enough for all the minorities whereas Jinnah\ndemanded an adequate constitutional protection of all minorities including Muslims.\nIn other words Gandhi stood by the Nehru Report and further worsened the\natmosphere by claiming to represent the INC and to speak for all Indians including\nMuslims. This stance of Gandhi annoyed both Allama Iqbal and Jinnah who firmly\nheld their viewpoint of safeguarding the rights of Muslims.\nBy the time the second RTC was held, the Labour Government, that had been\nenthusiastic about the RTCs, had now been replaced by a coalition or national\ngovernment dominated by the Conservative Party. The Conservatives were not much\ninterested in the proceeding of the RTC and their lack of interest also contributed\ntowards the failure of second RTC.

          "question": "Which of the following was the most important in the development\nof the Pakistan Movement:\n(i) 14 points of M.A Jinnah\n(ii) Gov. of India Act of 1935\n(iii) Simon Commission [14]",
          "answer": "The Pakistan Movement was a historic political movement which was aimed to break\nfrom the independent nation-state, Pakistan. Many leaders and political figures rose\nand spoke for the formation of Pakistan. They brought a sense of realization amongst\nthe people about Pakistan. In the face of such criticism, faced from the British and the\nHindus, they still remained steadfast and led to such circumstances which made the\ncreation and development of the Pakistan Movement inevitable. The political reforms\nsuch as the Simon Commission of 1927 also played some role in the development of\nthe Pakistan Movement. It was a commission sent to the sub-continent by Sir Simon\nin order to negotiate with Hindus and Muslims and to come up with a set of reforms\naccepted by both parties. It was a response of the 1919 reforms. But it also met the\nsame fate like the previous reforms and was rejected. But, in it’s failure was also\nhidden success for the Muslims. It led to the drawing up of the Nehru Report which\nproved to be an eye-opener for the Muslims.\nIn 1929, Jinnah came up with his fourteen points. This effort of Mr. Jinnah was the\ngolden key which opened the door to the Pakistan Movement. They were to be the\nbasis of the Muslim League’s position in any future negotiations with the Congress.\nIn this he asked for a future constitution to be federal, but giving provincial autonomy.\nHe asked to safeguard the rights of Muslims in all territory expanded areas. Although\nno demand for separate homeland was made, yet it brought political perception\namong the Muslims which proved very vital for the years to come ahead.\nLater in 1935 the Government of India Act was passed and was the last major\nlegislation that the British passed before the final independence. The most salient\nupshot of this Act was that provincial governments became in effect self-governing\nand were no longer controlled by the British. Although the British had no intention of\ngiving up India, their power over the provinces was weakening and Independence\ncame closer. This was significant for the Muslims as now they could fight for their\nrights. It was very important in the history as it provided negotiations which finally\nresulted in British leaving India.\nTo recapitulate, I infer from these details that the Fourteen Points of Mr. Jinnah were\nthe most important in the development of the Pakistan Movement. There’s an ample\nevidence that supports this fact. The Muslim League united in support of these\ndemands. These points prepared the Muslims of India for a bold step to struggle for\nfreedom. The vital role of these points can be judged by the fact that these points\nwere presented in the Round Table Conference of 1930.",

          "answer": "In 1929, Jinnah came up with his fourteen points which were in response of the Nehru\nReport of 1928. ML had rejected the Nehru Report as it asked for too many sacrifices.\nIt rejected the separate Muslim electorates and one third Muslim seats in the Central\nGovernment. Jinnah proposed three amendments to the report but the INC did not\naccept them. In his fourteen points Jinnah asked for maximum safeguarding of\npolitical rights of Muslims. He demanded that there should be one third Muslim seats\nin the Centre and the existing provincial boundaries should not be changed. He also\nproposed that no law about a community should be enforced without three fourth\nmembers of the same community in the legislative assembly approving it. These 14\npoints became the basis of any future negotiation with the INC or the British and\ngradually evolved into a demand for Pakistan in March 1940.\nIn 1928, the British asked the local people to frame a constitution for themselves. In\nresponse, the INC presented the Nehru Report. It was a purely Congress document\nas it rejected the Muslim right of separate electorates and their one third\nrepresentation in the Center. Jinnah proposed three amendments to it but the INC\nrejected them. A positive aspect of the Report was that it resulted in the unity of the\ndivided Muslim groups.\nThe British invited the Indians in the three Round Table Conferences, 1930-1932.\nDespite a deadlock between Gandhi and Jinnah, all parties agreed on a number of\nimportant clauses for the future constitutional reform for India. Based on the\nrecommendations of the three RTCs, the Government of India Act 1935 was passed.\nIt was the last package of political reforms introduced by the British before the\nindependence of India. It introduced a greater degree of provincial autonomy, federal\nform of government for India and shifting the diarchy from provinces to the Centre.\nSindh, the NWFP and Orissa were given provincial status, making a total of eleven\nprovinces in India. It allowed 25% Indians to exercise their right of vote which was a\nsignificant increase as compared to that for the 1919 Act. Though it was sharply\ncriticized by Nehru and Jinnah, both accepted it because the British had announced\nelections for the provincial assemblies.\nElections were held for the provincial assemblies in 1937. The ML did not perform\nwell in the elections and the INC was able to form its ministries in eight provinces. The\ntwo and a half year long INC rule was marked by several anti Muslim atrocities\ncommitted by the INC ministries. Muslims, therefore, got united after the end of the\nINC rule in 1939.\nTo conclude, it can be said that the introduction of Jinnah’s 14 points in 1929 was the\nmost important factor in the development of the Pakistan Movement as they\nrepresented the deep rooted fear among Muslims about a possible Hindu-dominated\nIndia. By asking for so many political safeguards for Muslims, it became apparent that\nML was preparing itself for the partition of India.\n\n\nElections 1937\n ML & INC didn’t approve the 1935 Act; accepted it due to elections, Jan-Feb 1937,\nfor provincial assemblies only\n Jinnah’s return, 1934; permanent president of ML; still hoped some Hindu-Muslim\nunity after the elections but Nehru unwilling.\nResults:\n INC won absolute majority in 5 provinces; formed govt in 8 provinces (including\nNWFP)\n ML: 109/482 seats reserved for Muslims; performed a little better in the Muslim\nminority provinces.\nImportance of the Elections\n First major elections; various factions of ML got united\n ML learned a lot about election campaign organization & planning; how to approach\nthe voters\n It realized: (1) its support lay in Muslim minority areas; no threat of Hindu domination\nin Muslim majority provinces; it would eventually make inroads in these provinces (2)\nit had an ‘image problem’ – a party dominated by the elite Muslims e.g., princes,\nNawabs etc, whereas INC was popular among all socio-economic segments of\nsociety.",

          "answer": "The 1937 elections taught ML important lessons. Despite opposing the 1935 Act, both\nML and INC accepted it as both decided to contest the elections for provincial\nassemblies that were to be held under the Act. ML did not perform well in the elections\nas compared to INC. Out of 489 Muslim seats the ML won only 109, though it captured\na number of seats in the Hindu majority provinces. These were the first major elections\ncontested by ML that gained good experience of launching the election campaign and\ncreating a good vote bank. Jinnah had little time to re-organized a highly disorganized\nML and so, the ML leaders realized how organized INC was.\nML also realized that it had the ‘image problem’. For most of Muslims, the ML was a\nparty of the elite Muslim community dominated by rich Muslim landed aristocrats. INC\non the other hand, had been a party popular among all segments and socio-economic\nclasses of India. Jinnah, therefore, would make hectic efforts 1937 onwards to\novercome this image problem so that ML could make inroads into all classes and\nspheres of India.\nThe elections told ML of the importance of winning seats in Hindu majority provinces\nbecause there was no fear of Hindu domination in the Muslim majority provinces.\nVotes from Hindu majority provinces were crucial for ML because they reflected the\ngrowing political awareness and fear of Hindu domination in the Muslims of these\nprovinces. ML could use these votes to prove its claim of representing all Indian\nMuslims. This way the INC claim of ‘an all Indian party’ could be effectively countered.",

          "question": "How successful were the provincial elections held in India in 1937?\nExplain your answer. [10/14]",
          "answer": "Though the INC and ML did not approve of the 1935 Act, they decided to participate\nin the 1937 elections. Nehru, gradually unfolded the INC aims by saying, “The\nCongress can carry its message to the millions of voters and scores of millions\nof the disenfranchised, to acquaint them with our future programme and\npolicy.” The results of the elections were shocking for the ML as the INC got a\nmassive victory by winning 707 seats out of a total of 1585 seats. It was the single\nlargest party in four while it had an absolute majority in five more provinces. It claimed\nto be the sole representative of all the Indians as it was able to rule many major\nprovinces. It was invited to form governments in the United Provinces (UP), the\nCentral Provinces (CP), Bihar, Orissa, Madras (Chennai), Bombay (Mumbai), and\nlater, Assam and the NWFP (KPK). Thus it formed ministries in these provinces.\n\n\nHowever, the Congress alienated the ML after the elections as it asked the victorious\nML members to join the INC. It refused to cooperate with the ML where the latter was\nthe largest single party. The INC agreed to the Muslims forming the government as\nlong as they were not the members of the ML. Its claim to represent the whole of India\nfurther frustrated the Muslims. Once Nehru was assured by Lord Linlithgow, the\nViceroy, that the provincial governors would not use their special powers to interfere\nin the provincial governments, he asked the INC to form cabinets in 8 provinces. It\nsoon introduced a series of measures which threatened Muslim culture and political\ninterests. Singing of Bande Matram, the Hindu nationalistic song was made\ncompulsory before the start of official business in the morning. Gandhi’s educational\npolicy, the Wardhah Scheme and the Congress tyranny drove a wedge in any possible\nHindu-Muslim unity.\nThese were the first major elections for the ML, and they unified various factions of\nthe ML. It learned a great deal about how to launch election campaign and contest\nelections. It realized the need of improving its organization and planning. It decided\nto seek more support from the Muslim minority provinces as there was no threat of\nHindu domination in the Muslim majority provinces. It also realized that it had to\novercome its ‘image problem’ as it was generally seen to be a party of the eliete\nMuslims. Most of its leaders were aristocrats and princes.\nPerformance of the ML was disappointing as it won only 109 out of the 482 seats\nreserved for the Muslims, about 25% of the total Muslim seats. The INC, due to its\nstrong leadership, managed to get 26 Muslim seats, too. In the Punjab it got just 1\nseat out of a total of 86 Muslim seats. Majority of the seats, 101 were swept away by\nthe Unionist Party that was friendly towards the INC. The Khalsa Party of the Sikhs,\nand the INC also bagged some seats in the Punjab. Similarly, in the NWFP 7 seats\nwere won by the Hindu-Sikh Nationalists.\nMoreover, the Muslims felt betrayed by the British who they thought were mainly\nconcerned with giving the INC an opportunity to form governments without\nconsidering the Muslim rights. The British apathy towards the anti-Muslim policies of\nthe INC in various provinces further disappointed the Muslims. They developed a\nsense of insecurity in a Hindu dominated India.\nIt may be concluded that the poor performance of the ML, and the INC rule came as\na blessing in disguise for the Muslims. The INC policies strengthened the Muslim\nnationalism, and justified a demand for a separate homeland for the Indian Muslims.\nThe ML got a chance to bring Muslims on its platform. Therefore, the elections were\nquite successful for the two major political parties of India.\nThe INC Rule 1937-39\n INC victory in the 1937 elections\n INC ministries in 8 out of 11 provinces\n\n\n Nehru got assurance from Viceroy Lord Linlithgow about governors not using special\npowers to interfere with the provincial matters.\n In areas of ML victory, INC’s condition of ML members to leave ML.\n A series of anti-Muslim policies under the INC rule:\nBande Matram:\n Hindu nationalist song with anti-Muslim expressions; compulsory singing in morning\nin provincial assemblies; Muslims felt offended & worried about their future.\nThe Wardha Scheme:\n Gandhi’s educational scheme; spinning cotton by hand, part of teaching in schools;\nno religious education; Hindi, medium of education; compulsory bowing before\nGandhi’s portrait in schools for all students; for Muslims, it was anti-Islamic; fear of\nimposition of Hinduism.\nINC tyranny:\n Ban on beef in some places; ban on & disturbance of Azaan; attacks on mosques\nduring congregational prayer; pushing pigs into mosques during prayers; local\nauthorities were biased against Muslims; no complaints of Muslims were entertained;\nattacks on Muslim houses & anti-Muslim riots; hoisting INC flag with the Union Jack\nto show there were only 2 political powers in India; Muslims felt threatened about their\ncultural & political identity & importance.\n Linlithgow himself received reports of anti-Muslim measures from some places.\n Start of WW2, Sept 1939; INC ministers resigned; Muslims celebrated “Day of\nDeliverance” on Jinnah’s call, 22 Dec 1939, to mark end of INC rule.\nML under INC rule\n Rejection of Jinnah’s offer of INC-ML coalition, by INC\n Jinnah’s massive campaign to awaken Muslims & warn them of the Hindu aim of\nestablishing ‘Hindustan’.\n Chief Ministers of Punjab, Bengal & Assam joined ML by 1938; membership of ML\ngrew dramatically.\n INC began to recognize Jinnah but didn’t accept ML as the only party representing\nIndian Muslims.\n On the whole, v.poor Hindu-Muslim relations by 1939.",

      "raw_text": "\nQ: Which of the following was the most important in the development\nof the Pakistan Movement:\n(i) 14 points of M.A Jinnah\n(ii) Gov. of India Act of 1935\n(iii) Simon Commission [14]\nAns. The Pakistan Movement was a historic political movement which was aimed to break\nfrom the independent nation-state, Pakistan. Many leaders and political figures rose\nand spoke for the formation of Pakistan. They brought a sense of realization amongst\nthe people about Pakistan. In the face of such criticism, faced from the British and the\nHindus, they still remained steadfast and led to such circumstances which made the\ncreation and development of the Pakistan Movement inevitable. The political reforms\nsuch as the Simon Commission of 1927 also played some role in the development of\nthe Pakistan Movement. It was a commission sent to the sub-continent by Sir Simon\nin order to negotiate with Hindus and Muslims and to come up with a set of reforms\naccepted by both parties. It was a response of the 1919 reforms. But it also met the\nsame fate like the previous reforms and was rejected. But, in it’s failure was also\nhidden success for the Muslims. It led to the drawing up of the Nehru Report which\nproved to be an eye-opener for the Muslims.\nIn 1929, Jinnah came up with his fourteen points. This effort of Mr. Jinnah was the\ngolden key which opened the door to the Pakistan Movement. They were to be the\nbasis of the Muslim League’s position in any future negotiations with the Congress.\nIn this he asked for a future constitution to be federal, but giving provincial autonomy.\nHe asked to safeguard the rights of Muslims in all territory expanded areas. Although\nno demand for separate homeland was made, yet it brought political perception\namong the Muslims which proved very vital for the years to come ahead.\nLater in 1935 the Government of India Act was passed and was the last major\nlegislation that the British passed before the final independence. The most salient\nupshot of this Act was that provincial governments became in effect self-governing\nand were no longer controlled by the British. Although the British had no intention of\ngiving up India, their power over the provinces was weakening and Independence\ncame closer. This was significant for the Muslims as now they could fight for their\nrights. It was very important in the history as it provided negotiations which finally\nresulted in British leaving India.\nTo recapitulate, I infer from these details that the Fourteen Points of Mr. Jinnah were\nthe most important in the development of the Pakistan Movement. There’s an ample\nevidence that supports this fact. The Muslim League united in support of these\ndemands. These points prepared the Muslims of India for a bold step to struggle for\nfreedom. The vital role of these points can be judged by the fact that these points\nwere presented in the Round Table Conference of 1930.\n\n\nQ: Was the introduction of Jinnah’s 14 points in 1929 the most\nimportant factor in the development of the Pakistan Movement\nbetween 1928 and 1935? Give reasons for why you might agree or\ndisagree? [14]\nAns. In 1929, Jinnah came up with his fourteen points which were in response of the Nehru\nReport of 1928. ML had rejected the Nehru Report as it asked for too many sacrifices.\nIt rejected the separate Muslim electorates and one third Muslim seats in the Central\nGovernment.

          "answer": "INC introduced a number of anti-Muslim policies. Muslims hated INC rule so\nmuch that at the end of INC rule they celebrated the Day of Deliverance on 22nd\nDecember 1939. After taking charge in July 1937, Congress declared Bande Matram\nas the national anthem. This was a Bengali song composed by Bankim Chatterji and\nit meant “Hail you O’ motherland”. It contained anti Muslim sentiments through which\nHindus were encouraged to expel Muslims from Hindustan through expressions\npeculiar exclusively to Hinduism. For example, it says, “Thou art Durga, Lady and\nQueen, with her hands that strike, and her swords of sheen; thou art Lakshmi lotus\nthroned”. This was not a Congress policy, but the singing of the song was made\ncompulsory before the start of official business everyday in the provincial assemblies.\nThis greatly offended the Muslims who began to feel that were being forced to become\nfamiliar with Hinduism.\nA number of anti Muslim measures were adopted which were collectively\ncalled the INC tyrannies. The Congress flag was given the status of national flag by\nhoisting it together with the Union Jack. This was done to convey the message that\nthere were only two political powers in India i.e. British and Congress. Muslims felt\nthat INC was bent upon ignoring the political importance of Indian Muslims. Muslims\nwere forbidden to eat beef and received harsh punishments and slaughtering of cows\nwas prohibited. Muslims were not allowed to construct new mosques. Hindus would\nplay drum in front of mosques during the deliverance of Azan and pigs were pushed\ninto the mosques when Muslims were praying. Sometimes there were anti-Muslim\nriots in which Muslims were attacked and their houses and property set on fire. They\nalso feared that if they lodged complaint against the Hindus, the local administration\nwould act in favour of Hindus. Viceroy Lord Linlithgow himself admitted ‘many\ninstances of continued oppressions in small ways’. Muslims developed a strong fear\nabout their religious and cultural traditions in case of a Hindu dominated India.\nIn the INC ruled provinces, the Wardha Scheme was implemented. It was an\neducational scheme based on Gandhi’s views and introduced into all educational\ninstitutes. Under this, teaching was to be in Hindi. Spinning of cotton by hand was\nmade part of curriculum in all schools. Religious education was banned for all\nstudents. Students, regardless of their religion, were expected to bow before the\nportrait of Gandhi in a worship manner. Muslims saw these measures as an attempt\nto subvert their love for Islam as their religion did not allow bowing before any image\nor portrait. A ban on Urdu and religious education inculcated insecurity among\nMuslims about their cultural identity.\nIt seems that the most important reason for hatred against the INC rule was\nthe singing of Bande Matram /Vande Matram because through this song a kind of\n‘brain washing’ campaign was launched against Muslims. They were being prepared\nto adapt to Hindu traditions, otherwise their survival in the independent India would\nbe very difficult.",

This indeed endorsed the British viewpoint that Indians\nwere doomed to remain disunited.\nThe INC ministers had resigned with the sole purpose of pressurizing the British\nduring the initial phase of the WWII so that the British, who desperately needed the\nIndian support, could be persuaded to negotiate for the independence of India. By\ndistancing itself from the INC, the ML reduced the required pressure that could be\nexerted on the British who now concentrated on the war front getting rid of any chance\nof Hindu-Muslim united front during the war years.\nIn the final analysis it may be concluded that the celebration of the Day of\nDeliverance was not fully justified because by doing so the ML lost a good opportunity\nto drive the British out of India with the help of the INC.

          "question": "How did Jinnah reorganize ML between 1937 and 1939? [7]",
          "answer": "After failing to unite Hindus and Muslims, Jinnah devoted himself to organize Muslims\nand bring them on the platform of Muslim League. At the Lucknow meeting of ML in October\n1937, Jinnah urged the party members to build up support from the grass roots. He argued\nthat in the 1937 elections the ML won seats in the areas where it had established its branches\nbefore 1937. He launched an aggressive campaign to increase the vote bank of the ML. He\ntoured several cities to win support for the ML, and delivered convincing speeches in favour\nof the party. His efforts began to bear fruit, and its membership grew tremendously. By 1938,\nseveral thousand Muslims joined the ML including the Chief Minister of Bengal, Assam and\nPunjab.\nJinnah began to urge Muslims to seek political guidance from Islam. He advocated\nthat Islam taught its followers liberty, equality and strong bonds of fraternity. This had a\npositive impact on the Muslims who could now see that their rights and cultural interests were\nseriously threatened by the INC. During its rule 1937-1939, the INC had significantly\nendorsed the views of Jinnah. Though the Muslim members of the INC criticized Jinnah’s\nefforts and predicted his failure, he continued his efforts with a strong determination. At the\nannual meeting of the ML in 1938, a women’s sub-committee was set up, led by Miss Fatimah\nJinnah. This way Jinnah was able to involve Muslim women in the mission of the ML.\nThe INC was alarmed over this progress of the ML, and it began to recognize the\nimportance of the ML. Arrangements were made for talks between Jinnah and Nehru, though\nthe INC refused to accept Jinnah’s stance that the ML alone was the representative of all\nIndian Muslims. Consequently, by 1939 Hindu-Muslim relations were quite strained.\nTherefore, the Muslims, on the call of Jinnah, quite justifiably celebrated the Day of\nDeliverance in December 1939 to mark the end of the INC rule.

          "answer": "Allama Iqbal was a philosopher – poet who eventually became a politician. He was\nknighted in 1922 in recognition of his poetry and later he was elected as member of\nPunjab Legislative Assembly later in 1926. In the absence of Jinnah, Iqbal presided\nover the historic session of ML and in December 1930 at Allahabad. He elaborated\nthe two nation theory by highlighting the distinctive cultural, civilizational and historic\nfeatures of the Muslim community. He spoke against the imperialistic powers of the\nWest and said it was unfair to occupy lands of the independent people. He said,\n“European democracy cannot be applied to India without recognizing the fact of\ncommunal groups. I would like to see the Punjab, NWFP, Sindh and Balochistan\namalgamated into a single state”. This way, Iqbal predicted as well as expressed his\ndesire of the possibility of creation of a Muslim homeland in the North Western Muslim\nmajority provinces of India. As a result communal division of India was seriously\nconsidered by many Muslims during the 1930’s.\nIqbal is also important because of his inspiring poetry that gradually infused the spirit\nof Muslim nationalism among Muslims who began to see a clear goal ahead of them.\nHis poetry gave hope to the Muslims telling to them to be proud of their past and of\ntheir heritage. He believed that the British and the Hindus were equally opposed to\nthe Muslim cause. Ch Rehmat Ali scheme of Pakistan was greatly influenced by the\nviews of Allama Iqbal.\nHis efforts were strengthened by both Ch. Rehmat Ali and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. It\nwas Iqbal who had persuaded Jinnah to come back to India to lead the Muslim\ncommunity. Therefore, Jinnah on the passage of Lahore Resolution in March 1940\npaid rich tribute to Iqbal and wished if Iqbal had been alive to see his dream come\ntrue. Iqbal is rightly called the “Architect of Pakistan” as well as the first leader from\nthe ML to have dreamed of a separate Muslim homeland.",

          "question": "Why was Dr Allama Muhammad Iqbal was asked to chair the Muslim\nLeague at Allahabad in 1930?\n[7]",
          "answer": "Allama Iqbal had become a reputed politician, thinker and poet by 1930. His poetry\nhad an inspiring effect on the Indian Muslims by inculcating among them a sense of their\ndistinct nationalism. His poetry awakened Muslims to start struggling for making progress in\nvarious walks of life. The essence of his poetry was the philosophy of being self-dependent\n\n\nand vibrant. This enhanced his image as a sincere and mature thinker who was worried\nabout the future of Indian Muslims. With time, his political importance grew significantly in the\nlate 1920s.\nBy that time Jinnah was not in favour of the Two Nation theory as he believed in some\nkind of joint struggle against the British colonial rule. He, therefore, proposed four\namendments in the Nehru report, and promised to drop the demand of separate electorates\nof Muslims if the amendments were accepted by the Congress. Iqbal, on the other hand, was\nopposed to any such unity between Hindus and Muslims as he could foresee the\nconsequences of a united India ruled by the Hindu majority. He was also opposed to the\nBritish imperialism as it went against fundamental Islamic beliefs. He sharply criticised the\ncolonial rule in his 1938 address. Thus Iqbal’s views gradually evolved into the demand for a\nseparate Muslim homeland.\nHe, therefore, began to persuade many ML leaders to build an effective political force\nagainst the British rule as well as the Congress plans of a Hindu-dominated India. He had\nclosely observed the Western colonial mindset during his stay in Europe in the start of 20th\ncentury. Thus his views made him a well-respected and authoritative leader to represent the\nIndian Muslims. Finally, he made a formal demand for an independent state for Muslims while\npresiding over the annual ML session in December 1930. He elaborated his demand by\nstrong reasoning in his historic Allahabad address.\nCh. Rehmat Ali\nIntroduction:\n Born – 1897, Punjab;\n Educated at Islamia College, Lhr.\n Law practice 1918 onwards\n Masters degree in law, Cambridge University.\n Developed idea of a separate Muslim state in NW Indian provinces, 1930’s.\n Attended RTC’s 1930-32, tried to convince Muslim leaders to accept his idea.\n Jinnah & other leaders didn’t agree, thought such a scheme as too premature.\n 1933, Pakistan National Movement & his pamphlet, “Now or Never”, introduced the\nword “Pakistan”.\n Collection of his articles, “Pakistan – the fatherland of the Pak nation”.\nImportance of his work\n Issued first direct call for a separate Muslim state in the NW Muslim majority provinces\nof India; surpassed Sir Syed & Allama Iqbal in making his demand\n Gave a name to the proposed state – Pakistan, a meaningful term – literal meaning\n“land of the pure people (Muslims) & each letter for a Muslim majority area.

      "raw_text": "\nQ: Was the main reason why Congress rule (1937 – 1939) was hated\nso much because of the Bande Matram? Explain your answer. [14]\nAns: INC introduced a number of anti-Muslim policies. Muslims hated INC rule so\nmuch that at the end of INC rule they celebrated the Day of Deliverance on 22nd\nDecember 1939. After taking charge in July 1937, Congress declared Bande Matram\nas the national anthem. This was a Bengali song composed by Bankim Chatterji and\nit meant “Hail you O’ motherland”. It contained anti Muslim sentiments through which\nHindus were encouraged to expel Muslims from Hindustan through expressions\npeculiar exclusively to Hinduism. For example, it says, “Thou art Durga, Lady and\nQueen, with her hands that strike, and her swords of sheen; thou art Lakshmi lotus\nthroned”. This was not a Congress policy, but the singing of the song was made\ncompulsory before the start of official business everyday in the provincial assemblies.\nThis greatly offended the Muslims who began to feel that were being forced to become\nfamiliar with Hinduism.\nA number of anti Muslim measures were adopted which were collectively\ncalled the INC tyrannies. The Congress flag was given the status of national flag by\nhoisting it together with the Union Jack. This was done to convey the message that\nthere were only two political powers in India i.e. British and Congress. Muslims felt\nthat INC was bent upon ignoring the political importance of Indian Muslims. Muslims\nwere forbidden to eat beef and received harsh punishments and slaughtering of cows\nwas prohibited. Muslims were not allowed to construct new mosques. Hindus would\nplay drum in front of mosques during the deliverance of Azan and pigs were pushed\ninto the mosques when Muslims were praying. Sometimes there were anti-Muslim\nriots in which Muslims were attacked and their houses and property set on fire. They\nalso feared that if they lodged complaint against the Hindus, the local administration\nwould act in favour of Hindus. Viceroy Lord Linlithgow himself admitted ‘many\ninstances of continued oppressions in small ways’. Muslims developed a strong fear\nabout their religious and cultural traditions in case of a Hindu dominated India.\nIn the INC ruled provinces, the Wardha Scheme was implemented. It was an\neducational scheme based on Gandhi’s views and introduced into all educational\ninstitutes. Under this, teaching was to be in Hindi. Spinning of cotton by hand was\nmade part of curriculum in all schools. Religious education was banned for all\nstudents. Students, regardless of their religion, were expected to bow before the\nportrait of Gandhi in a worship manner. Muslims saw these measures as an attempt\nto subvert their love for Islam as their religion did not allow bowing before any image\nor portrait. A ban on Urdu and religious education inculcated insecurity among\nMuslims about their cultural identity.\nIt seems that the most important reason for hatred against the INC rule was\nthe singing of Bande Matram /Vande Matram because through this song a kind of\n‘brain washing’ campaign was launched against Muslims. They were being prepared\nto adapt to Hindu traditions, otherwise their survival in the independent India would\nbe very difficult.\n\n\nQ: Do you agree that the celebration of Day of Deliverance in 1939 was\njustified? Give reasons. [14]\nAns: Day of Deliverance was observed by Muslim League on 22nd December 1939 after\nthe end of the INC ministers. After taking charge in July 1937, INC adopted an anti\nMuslim stance in the provinces under its rule. A number of anti Muslim measures were\nintroduced which were collectively called the INC tyrannies.

          "question": "Why did Muslims not demand complete independence from Britain\nbefore 1940?\n(7)",
          "answer": "Muslims wanted a greater role, like Hindus, in running India. For this reason\nthe ML on Jinnah’s advice in 1913, changed it’s policy of promoting loyalty to\nthe British. It began to ask for self rule as it felt betrayed over the reversal of\npartition of Bengal in 1911. The ML, however, knew if it pressured the British\ntoo much, the latter might leave India putting them at the mercy of Hindus. It’s\nfears got stronger when the Nehru Report was presented in 1928. The Nehru\nReport rejected the Muslim demands of separate electorates and one third\nseats in the Central Legislative Assembly. It declared these demands were\nbased on the “illegal fear” of the Muslims. The report asked for a strong central\ngovernment that would surely be dominated by the Hindus.\nJinnah, therefore, tried to persuade the INC to amend the Nehru Report to\nmake it acceptable to the Muslims, but his advice was rejected. Jinnah, till the\nlate 1930’s had a hope of Hindu-Muslim unity, but the INC rule of 1937-39\ncompelled him to demand a separate homeland for the Muslims. This period\nof the INC rule was marked by a number of anti-Muslim policies in the\nprovinces controlled by the INC as a result of which the Muslim fear of living\nunder a Hindu- dominated India got materialised into a demand of their own\nsovereign state.

He was\nknighted in 1922 in recognition of his poetry and later he was elected as member of\nPunjab Legislative Assembly later in 1926. In the absence of Jinnah, Iqbal presided\nover the historic session of ML and in December 1930 at Allahabad. He elaborated\nthe two nation theory by highlighting the distinctive cultural, civilizational and historic\nfeatures of the Muslim community. He spoke against the imperialistic powers of the\nWest and said it was unfair to occupy lands of the independent people. He said,\n“European democracy cannot be applied to India without recognizing the fact of\ncommunal groups. I would like to see the Punjab, NWFP, Sindh and Balochistan\namalgamated into a single state”. This way, Iqbal predicted as well as expressed his\ndesire of the possibility of creation of a Muslim homeland in the North Western Muslim\n\n\nmajority provinces of India. As a result communal division of India was seriously\nconsidered by many Muslims during the 1930’s.\nIqbal is also important because of his inspiring poetry that gradually infused\nthe spirit of Muslim nationalism among Muslims who began to see a clear goal ahead\nof them. His poetry gave hope to the Muslims telling to them to be proud of their past\nand of their heritage. He believed that the British and the Hindus were equally\nopposed to the Muslim cause. Ch Rehmat Ali scheme of Pakistan was greatly\ninfluenced by the views of Allama Iqbal.\nHis ideas were followed and strengthened by both Ch. Rehmat Ali and\nMuhammad Ali Jinnah. It was Iqbal who had persuaded Jinnah to come back to India\nto lead the Muslim community. Therefore, Jinnah on the passage of Lahore\nResolution in March 1940 paid rich tribute to Iqbal and wished if Iqbal had been alive\nto see his dream come true. Iqbal is rightly called the “Architect of Pakistan” as well\nas the first leader from the ML to have dreamed of a separate Muslim homeland. He\npresented the scheme of Pakistan. As a young student, he attended the Round Table\nConferences in London in the 1930s and was opposed to any kind of federation of\nIndia. Instead, he believed in launching an active struggle for a totally independent\nand separate Muslim homeland comprising the north-western Muslim majority\nprovinces of India. He tried to persuade the Muslim leaders to accept his scheme but\nfailed to impress them, though the idea of partition of India appealed many.\nHe gave the name Pakistan to the independent Muslim state in his famous\npamphlet ‘Now or Never’ that was published in 1933. Literal meaning of the word\nPakistan is ‘land o..."

          "answer": "A number of negotiations were held with successes and failures. With the start\nof the WWII the INC (Congress) ministers resigned with the intention of pressurizing\nthe British for granting independence.\nThe British needed Indian support in the WWII. So, they dispatched a team,\nthe Cripps Mission led by Sir Stafford Cripps, with a set of proposals for the future of\nIndia in March 1942. The Cripps Mission proposed the making of a Union of India in\nwhich almost all the ministers were to be Indians, and the possibility of granting\ndominion status to India after the war. It also provided for any province to opt out of\nthe proposed Union of India. The Plan reflected British willingness to gradually\ndecolonize India. Gandhi and Jinnah rejected the proposals and this showed the\npossibility of a united stance against the British, though Gandhi and Jinnah had their\nown reasons to reject it. For Gandhi, the British were not in a position to put forward\nsuch a scheme as they would have to leave India sooner or later. He, therefore,\ncommented on the plan by saying that it was a post- dated cheque on a failing bank.\nHe launched the Quit India movement and was arrested with many other INC leaders.\nJinnah felt disappointed as he wanted a clear mention of Pakistan and was not\nsatisfied with the ‘opting out clause’. So, the plan was turned down by Indians.\nAfter Gandhi was released from jail, he wrote to Jinnah to hold talks with him\nabout the future of India. Jinnah accepted it and invited Gandhi at his home in\nBombay. Several rounds of talk hiss were held in June, 1944. The talks showed\nGandhi’s acknowledgement of Jinnah as a major leader. He also suggested joint\nstruggle of INC and ML after which the partition of India could be discussed. This\nshows his conditional acceptance of Pakistan. However, the talks had more failures\nthan successes. Gandhi insisted on being treated as an ordinary Indian but this\nirritated Jinnah’s legal mind as for him Gandhi was only an INC spokesman. Gandhi\nalso rejected the two nation theory by saying that a community couldn’t become a\nnation just by changing religion. Majority of Indian Muslims were local converts from\nHinduism or Sikhism. Jinnah asked for keeping the defence and foreign affairs under\nthe provincial governments in case of a united India. So the talks ended in a deadlock.\n\n\nBy June 1945, the WWII was nearing end and British were now determined to\nleave India. Viceroy Lord Wavell, after consulting with the British government, drafted\nthe Wavell Plan. The plan was discussed in the Simla Conference in June-July 1945.\nThe ML delegation included Jinnah, Liaquat Ali Khan and Abul Kalam Azad, the INC\nPresident. Lord Wavell unfolded the plan of an interim Executive Council\n(government) comprising equal number of Hindu and Muslim ministers. All parties\nagreed on the idea of the Executive Council, and the independence of India. However,\nGandhi insisted on nominating Hindus as well as some Muslim ministers. Inclusion of\nAzad was aimed at conveying the message that INC too represented Muslims. Jinnah\nreplied that ML alone was a party of all Muslims as it had been winning almost all by\nelections for the Muslim seats during the last 3 years. Jinnah also objected to equal\nnumber of Hindu and Muslim ministers by pointing towards other non-Muslim\nminorities. If those minorities allied themselves with INC, Muslims would remain a\nminority. The session ended without any success and Wavell admitted failure of the\nconference on 14th July, 1945.\nIf analyzed objectively, it seems that these negotiations were all successful\nbecause each of these resulted in building of more pressure on British by both INC\nand ML. The cumulative result of negotiations eventually forced the British to leave\nas well as partition India in 1947.\nOR (if students wished to prove that the negotiations achieved nothing)\nIt analyzed objectively, the negotiations were all failures because each led to a\ndeadlock mainly because of the ever widening gulf between the ML and INC that\nbenefitted British only as they were able to prolong their stay in India.\n\n\nNew Pattern Question\nSource A, comments on the INC claims:\n“Many other non-Muslim Indians resented Congress claiming to speak for them.

In the Lucknow meeting of the ML in October 1937 he persuaded the party\nto build up support from the grass roots. Due to his efforts the chief ministers of\nAssam, Bengal and Punjab joined the party by 1938 and the vote bank of the ML was\nenlarged significantly. It was able to win most of the by-elections between 1940 and\n1945.\nIt had learned a lot from the 1937 elections. So, it launched a more effective\ncampaign in 1945. It made successful efforts to overcome the ‘image problem’. For\nmany years the ML was seen as a party of elite Muslim class because the\ncircumstances of its foundation were marked by the presence of rich\nlandowners/nawabs. A mass contact campaign was launched by Jinnah to approach\nall segments of the Muslim community in various provinces.\nThe INC rule 1937-39 had shocked Muslims into unity. They realized that in\nan INC-dominated India their political and cultural identity would be seriously\nthreatened. Therefore, only three months after the celebration of the Day of\nDeliverance, Muslims got united on the ML platform to make a demand for Pakistan.\nThis demand changed the political landscape of India, and by 1945 the Muslims had\na clear objective and goal to achieve.

          "answer": "The Labour Party won a massive and unexpected victory in the 1945 General\nElection. It won 393 seats against the Conservative Party that won only 197 seats.\nThe party was opposed to imperialism and eager to promote independence for India\nfollowing the election. Thus the signs for an independent state of some kind looked\nvery positive. However, there was a problem, since the new government was pro-\nCongress and Gandhi, so partition was most unlikely and instead the favoured route\nwas for a federal India rather than two separate states.\nHowever, there were other factors too, that led to the partition of India in 1947.\nFollowing the Simla Conference in 1945, Lord Wavell announced new elections. The\n\n\nresults demonstrated that the Congress had control of the non-Muslim votes but that\nthe League had equally gained control of the Muslim vote. It was clear that the League\nwas an equal player to the Congress and that the demand for partition could no longer\nbe ignored by the Congress or the British Government. However, in March 1946,\nmembers of the British Cabinet Mission arrived in India to work out a plan for achieving\nindependence for India as a federation. The Mission met with some 470 Indian leaders\nbut Jinnah stuck firm to his stance that partition was the only way forward as far as\nthe Muslims were concerned. Once the plans for groupings the provinces were\nknown, the ML accepted the plan as long as the groupings were to be compulsory.\nCongress however refused to accept the groupings and that they would not be bound\nby any British plan. The British government decided to form an Interim Government\nheaded by Nehru of Congress. Eventually members of the ML joined it too.\nThe ML got worried that the British would leave India without organizing a\nsettlement and didn’t want Congress to be left in charge of organizing a new country.\nThus the ML organised a Direct Action Day in the summer of 1946 in an attempt to\nstop the British government giving in to Congress. Rioting on a massive scale took\nplace and thousands died. The British got increasingly worried that civil war would\nensue and gradually a change of mind grew over partition. In February 1947 came\nthe announcement by Attlee that the British would leave the sub-continent by 1948\nand the subsequent violence in the Punjab in March 1947 that convinced Nehru that\npartition should take place quickly. This was formalized in the 3rd June Plan of 1947\nin which Mountbatten, the new Viceroy brought about partition in August 1947.\nIt may be concluded that the victory of the Labour Party was the most decisive\nfactor in the partition of India. After winning the election it acted wisely and preferred\nto reconstruct England after the WW-II instead of retaining the burden of colonial rule\nover India. Moreover, it had demanded independence of India after the Atlantic\nCharter agreed between British PM and the US President in August 1941.\n\n\nThe Cabinet Mission Plan, 1946\n Last British attempt for Indian unity → some solution acceptable to all parties\n A 3 member-mission of British cabinet →Stafford Cripps, A.V. Alexander &\nPethic Lawrence (Secretary of State for India) reached India, March 1946\n Dialogue with major parties & found:\no Jinnah wanted independent Pakistan with undivided Punjab & Bengal→\nafter this, central agency might be considered to look after some common\nsubjects\no INC → totally independent & undivided India\no Cabinet Mission → an interim govt, while the British were leaving → the\ninterim govt to form an All India Commission of elected members → the\ncommission to decide whether one or two constitutions for India → INC &ML\nrejected it.\no May 1946, final proposal of the Mission → grouping of provinces → no\nPakistan ; 3 groups of provinces → (1) the Hindu Majority Provinces (2) NW\nMuslims majority provinces (3) NE Muslim majority Provinces.\no Full autonomy for each group → could make its own constitution\no Defence, foreign affairs & communication to be under a Central Indian\nUnion.\no ML approved it, but Nehru →declared it just a proposal & so, not binding on\nfuture Indian govt after independence.\no ML was forced to drop the plan.\nDirect Action Day\n Summer 1946 → British withdrawal ready\n ML feared Hindu domination if British left without settling the question of\nPakistan → ML wanted to convey a message of its strength to the British.\n July 1946 → ML passed resolution asking Muslims to be ready for final struggle\nfor Pakistan.\n 16 Aug 1946 → Direct Action Day to show strength.\n ‘Great Calcutta Killing’ → 4000 people were killed.",

(4)\nAns. In March 1945, Lord Wavell consulted the British government and drafted the Wavell\nPlan, and invited all political parties of India to Simla to discuss it. The Simla\nConference was held in June 1945. The Wavell Plan proposed an Executive Council\ncomprising equal number of Hindu and Muslim ministers, with control over all affairs\nexcept for the Viceroy and a British member controlling the defence. The Conference,\nattended by all major Indian political parties, ended in failure on 14 July 1945 due to\na deadlock between Gandhi and Jinnah.\nQ: Why did the Simla Conference fail? (7)\nAns. It was held in June-July 1945. The Viceroy, Lord Wavell drew up a plan for the\nfuture of India and convened the Simla Conference to discuss it with all political parties\nof India. Jinnah, Liaqat Ali Khan and Kh. Nazim-ud-Din represented the ML. The\nWavell Plan suggested the formation of an Executive Council with an equal number\nof Hindu and Muslim ministers. Jinnah pointed out that the other non-Muslim parties\nwould surely support the INC, making Muslims a permanent minority in the Executive\nCouncil. They included the Sikhs, the Scheduled Castes and the Christians. Lord\nWavell could not increase the number of Muslim ministers who were already granted\na share greater than their numerical strength in India.\nGandhi was accompanied by the INC president Abul Kalam Azad with the\nintention of weakening the ML claim of representing all Muslims of India. Therefore,\nhe demanded that the INC should be given the right of nominating some Muslim\nministers, too. Jinnah rejected this demand by saying that the ML had been winning\nall Muslim seats in every by election held since 1940.\nJinnah also knew that the acceptance of Gandhi’s demand of nominating a\nMuslim minister would surely loosen the grip of the ML in some provinces of his\nproposed map of Pakistan as the INC was already popular in the NWFP. So, the\nConference failed to reach a consensus on the Wavell Plan.\n\n\nQ: Do you agree that during the Second World War there was no\nsignificant progress towards independence in the sub-continent?\nGive reasons for your answer. [14]\nAns. A number of negotiations were held with successes and failures. With the start\nof the WWII the INC (Congress) ministers resigned with the intention of pressurizing\nthe British for granting independence.\nThe British needed Indian support in the WWII. So, they dispatched a team,\nthe Cripps Mission led by Sir Stafford Cripps, with a set of proposals for the future of\nIndia in March 1942. The Cripps Mission proposed the making of a Union of India in\nwhich almost all the ministers were to be Indians, and the possibility of granting\ndominion status to India after the war. It also provided for any province to opt out of\nthe proposed Union of India. The Plan reflected British willingness to gradually\ndecolonize India. Gandhi and Jinnah rejected the proposals and this showed the\npossibility of a united stance against the British, though Gandhi and Jinnah had their\nown reasons to reject it. For Gandhi, the British were not in a position to put forward\nsuch a scheme as they would have to leave India sooner or later. He, therefore,\ncommented on the plan by saying that it was a post- dated cheque on a failing bank.\nHe launched the Quit India movement and was arrested with many other INC leaders.\nJinnah felt disappointed as he wanted a clear mention of Pakistan and was not\nsatisfied with the ‘opting out clause’. So, the plan was turned down by Indians.\nAfter Gandhi was released from jail, he wrote to Jinnah to hold talks with him\nabout the future of India.

Jinnah felt disappointed as he wanted a clear mention of Pakistan\nand was not satisfied with the ‘opting out clause’. So, the plan was turned down by\nIndians. The British, it seems, had indirectly acknowledge the idea of Pakistan.\nTwo years before the Cripps Mission, a historic session of ML was held in Minto Park\nLahore, 22-23 March, 1940. It was presided over by Mr. Jinnah. Maulvi Fazal ul Haq\npresented the Lahore Resolution demanding that ‘Regions in which the Muslims are\nnumerically a majority, as in the north western and eastern zone of India, should be\ngrouped to constitute independent state(s) in which the constituent units shall be\nautonomous and sovereign’. The Resolution was passed on 23rd March and\neventually became known as the Pakistan Resolution. The Resolution was\nunanimously adopted by all ML representatives from both Muslims majority and\nMuslim minority provinces. It was a success for ML as it now formally started the\nPakistan Movement and mobilized Indian Muslims on the ML platform for their\ncommon goal.\nAfter Gandhi was released from jail, he wrote to Jinnah to hold talks with him about\nthe future of India. Jinnah accepted it and invited Gandhi at his home in Bombay.\nSeveral rounds of talk hiss were held in June, 1944. The talks showed Gandhi’s\nacknowledgement of Jinnah as a major leader and ML as a major Muslim Political\nparty. He also suggested joint struggle of INC and ML after which the partition of India\ncould be discussed. This shows his conditional acceptance of Pakistan. Though\nGandhi rejected the two nation theory by saying that Muslims were mainly local\nconverts, Jinnah asserted that Muslims were a nation by any definition because of\ntheir historic, cultural, religious and linguistic differences with Hindus. Jinnah asked\nfor keeping the defence and foreign affairs under the provincial governments in case\nof a united India. This shows strength of Jinnah’s determination for achieving\nPakistan.\n\n\nThe 1945-46 elections results were in favour of Pakistan.ML swept the board with\n87% of the Muslim votes. In the Central Assembly, ML won all 30 seats reserved for\nMuslims. In the Provincial Assemblies too it performed impressively by winning\n446/495 seats. The results proved that ML was the only major party for Muslims.\nPerformance of ML justified and augmented its demanded for Pakistan.\nFinally, after hectic efforts, Lord Mountbatten announced the plan of independence of\nIndia on 3rd June, 1947.Under the 3rd June Plan India was to be divided into two states,\nIndia and Pakistan on 15th August 1947.

The 3rd June Plan was the fruit of all efforts of Jinnah and ML in\nkeeping Indian Muslims united for a common goal of achieving Pakistan. The Plan\nalso reflected the magnitude of the pressure of ML on both the British and INC.\nCripps Mission may be regarded as the most important contribution towards Pakistan\nbecause through it British demonstrated their willingness to leave and hinted at the\npossibility of Pakistan. This boosted the confidence of ML making it more determined.\nOr\nStudents may give the following judgement:\nThe Lahore Resolution was the most important factor in the creation of Pakistan\nbecause it was a collective demand of Muslims of both Muslim majority and Muslim\nminority provinces through the platform of ML. After the passage of Lahore Resolution\nML remained unshaken in its commitment of achieving a separate homeland for\nMuslims.",

Lord Wavell’s invitation to the Congress\nto form an interim government added to their concerns. It was also known that a majority of\nthe Labour Members of the Parliament were more sympathetic to the Congress than to the\nIdea of Pakistan.

          "question": "Why was Pakistan faced with a refugee problem in 1947? (7)",
          "answer": "Communal violence had started in India in the summer of 1947 when the 3rd June\nPlan was announced. Although Congress and the Muslim League called for peace, violence\ngrew across India with the passage of time. Several Muslims wanted to live in their\nindependent homeland. They began to migrate, and these migrating families were attacked\nby angry mobs led by extremist Hindus and Sikhs.\nThe Radcliffe Award divided Bengal and Punjab along religious lines into the Indian\nand Pakistani provinces. With this many people found themselves living in the wrong country.\nMuslims in many parts of Punjab and neighbouring provinces were forced to leave India. It is\nalleged that the Indian government deliberately created difficulties for the newly created state\nof Pakistan. In non-Muslim princely states the local authorities used troops to support attacks\non Muslims, forcing them to migrate. Karachi alone received about 2 million emigrants.\nThings got so worse that martial law was imposed on Delhi in September 1947 to stop\nthe massacre of Muslims. Hindus and Sikhs living in Pakistan were, in retaliation, targeted by\nthe Pakistani Muslims. They attacked their houses and forced them to leave Pakistan.\nConsequently, round 20 million people became homeless in both the countries. Nearly one\nmillion deaths were reported of the Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs. It became difficult for Pakistan\nto accommodate so many refugees as it did not have enough resources to provide food,\nshelter, clothing and medical aid to a huge population of refugees.",

          "question": "Formation of a government was the most important challenge faced\nby the newly created state of Pakistan in 1947.\nDo you agree? Explain. (14)",
          "answer": "Pakistan had to make an efficient government in 1947. There was a shortage of the\nstate buildings, office equipment and devoted and experienced politicians. Also, there\nwere not many experienced officers and civil servants to run the state affairs. Except\nfor Jinnah, Liaqat Ali Khan and few others, most of the politicians were either\ninexperienced or insincere. India, on the other hand, had a huge team of skilled\npoliticians with Lord Mountbatten as its 1st Governor General. Therefore, Pakistan\nfound it difficult to build a strong political base. The process of making a constitution\nwas also delayed as there were not many experts in the Constituent Assembly. Due\nto a shortage of state buildings, military barracks were temporarily used as offices.\nAbove all, Jinnah’s deteriorating health and his death only one year after the creation\nof Pakistan worsened the political problems.\nDivision of military and financial assets was also a major dispute. Pakistan needed\nfunds and military equipment to run the state affairs and ensure its defence. India\nunwillingly gave damaged and worn out weapons to Pakistan under the agreed ratio\nof 36% of military assets for Pakistan. So, Pakistan was forced to build an arms\nmanufacturing factory, the POF (Pakistan Ordinance Factory) at Wah. Only the\ndivision of the troops went smoothly as majority of Muslim troops opted for Pakistan\nand majority of non-Muslims for India. Similarly, out of a total of 750 million rupees,\nthe Indian government first gave only 200 million rupees to Pakistan. Then the war on\nKashmir broke out and India withheld the remaining payment saying Pakistan would\nbuy weapons with that money. On Gandhi’s insistence, another 500 million rupees\nwere given to Pakistan. The remaining 50 million rupees were never paid.\n\n\nAnother big problem was the accommodation of refugees coming from India. After\npartition of India, Muslims living in the Indian Punjab and the neighbouring districts\nwere forced to migrate to Pakistan. The migrating families were attacked in an\norganized way by the militant Hindus and Sikhs. Pakistan began to receive trains\nloaded with the dead and the injured. The government of Pakistan had little to provide\nshelter, medical care and food to millions of refugees on urgent grounds. They were\naccommodated in refugee camps and military barracks without appropriate facilities\nof living.\nThen there was the issue of the division of the canal water. In April 1948, India\nclosed the two headworks Madhupur and Firozpur that controlled the waters of Ravi\nand Sutlej rivers of Pakistan. This created a serious shortage of water threatening the\ncrop production in the affected areas of Punjab. This issue was finally solved under\nthe mediation of the World Bank through Indus Water Treaty in 1960.\nDivision of the princely states was also a problem. India had a total of 462 princely\nstates and these states were given choice of accession either to India or to Pakistan\nafter the partition. 459 states joined either state on the basis of their location and\npopulation composition quite smoothly. Problem arose in the states of Hyderabad,\nJunagadh and Kashmir. Hyderabad and Junagadh had Muslim rulers ruling the non-\nMuslim majority states. India occupied the two states using its military. State of\nJammu and Kashmir had a Muslim majority but was ruled by the Maharaja of the\nDogra Dynasty. Much to the disappointment of the Kashmiri Muslims, the Maharaja\ncontinued to delay the announcement of accession to Pakistan. This led to protest\nand violence in Kashmir. The Maharaja invited the Indian army to help him, and this\nresulted in the 1st Pak-India war in the start of 1948. A ceasefire was reached with the\nhelp of the UN and a temporary boundary line, the LoC (Line of Control) was drawn\nbetween the IHK (Indian Held Kashmir) and Azad Kashmir. It still remains an\nunresolved issue between the two states.\nEast and West Pakistan were separated by a 1600 km long Indian territory. This\ncreated difficulties of communication between the two wings of Pakistan. People living\nin the two wings were often ignorant of the problems of each other. This geographical\ngap was exploited by India to create difficulties for Pakistan. During the Pak-India war,\nthe Indian government would deny its territory to the Pakistani aeroplanes flying\nbetween East and West Pakistan. Moreover, the cultural differences between the two\nwings and within West Pakistan also created political and social problems. Various\ncultural communities of Pakistan had little in common except for Islam.\nIt seems that formation of a government was the most important problem because if\nPakistan had established a concrete political foundation after independence, it would\nhave been able to overcome other problems with less difficulty while starting some\nsocial development projects with a team of expert politicians.",

          "answer": "Mr. Jinnah became the first Governor General of Pakistan, in August 1947. India had\nwithheld Pakistan’s share in the financial and military assets. Mr. Jinnah negotiated with the\nIndian government for the release of 750 million rupees. He took several other steps to run\nthe newly created state. He inaugurated the State Bank of Pakistan in July 1948, and\nPakistan issued its own currency. A Development Board was set up in 1948 for planning a\nstrategy for the industrial development. When India closed the Firozpur and Madhupur\nheadworks, Pakistan faced serious shortage of water. Mr. Jinnah persuaded the Indian\ngovernment to release some water so that Pakistan’s agriculture was not destroyed. The\nissue of canal waters was, however, fully resolved as late as 1960.\nThe Government of Pakistan presented its first budget in 1948-49. It was a balanced\nbudget which indicated Pakistan’s stable economic conditions. However, despite his best\nefforts, there was no major industrial development till the 1960’s. India gave 700 million\nrupees to Pakistan but the remaining 50 million were never paid. Jinnah took various steps\nfor the formation of a government. He declared Karachi as the capital of Pakistan and\ninaugurated the headquarters of the armed forces and the civil secretariat. He made it clear\nthat the sole role of the army was to be ‘the servant of the people’. However, the future\ngovernments could not keep army from politics.\nJinnah appointed the first Constituent Assembly and the first cabinet with Liaqat Ali\nKhan as the Prime Minister. The 1935 Act was adopted as the interim constitution with some\namendments. He urged the civil servants to dedicate their lives to the service of the nation.\nIn order to highlight Pakistan’s peaceful aims, Pakistan joined the UNO in September 1947.\nJinnah wanted peaceful relations with India just like the US-Canada relations.\nHowever, Jinnah retained executive powers which, according to the parliamentary\nform of government, should have been relegated to the PM. He used to chair the Cabinet\nmeetings, and take important decisions. This was used as a wrong precedent by the future\nGovernor Generals. The process of constitution making was lingered on even after his death\nas he had to induct some non-political figures in the cabinet due to a shortage of genuine\npoliticians. His dream of good relations with India was also shattered and both countries had\ntheir first war in 1948.\nFor building a nation, Jinnah declared Urdu as the national language, so that it could\nunify various linguistic groups in Pakistan. In order to ensure the protection of religious\nminorities Jinnah declared himself as the “Protector General of Minorities”. In his address to\nthe Constituent Assembly, he had made it clear that all Pakistanis were free to follow their\nreligion without any fear. Declaring Urdu as the only national language was strongly resented\nby East Pakistan where all people spoke Bengali. They considered this as a step of West\nPakistan’s domination over East Pakistan. The Quaid was opposed to religious intolerance,\nprovincialism and racialism. In order to safeguard the rights of the minorities, and project\nPakistan as a tolerant state he adopted the symbolic title of the ‘Protector-General’ of religious\nminorities. His advice was often sought by the non-Muslims, and he inducted a Hindu minister\nin the cabinet.\nTo help the refugees, he set up the Quaid-e-Azam Relief Fund, and temporarily\nshifted his headquarter to Lahore to personally supervise the process of their\naccommodation. Unfortunately, millions of refugees would continue to suffer after his death\nbecause of shortage of the required resources. All of them could not get medical care, jobs\nand accommodation. He also negotiated with the Indian government for the Canal Water",

          "answer": "Jinnah faced many serious challenges to run the newly created state of Pakistan.\nAfter the 3rd June 1947 Plan, the ML had a little over two months to make preparations for\nhandling the largest Muslim state in the world. In order to frame a constitution, he established\nthe Constituent Assembly on 10 August 1947, under his Chaimanship. He addressed the\nAssembly on 11 August, and urged the need of making a constitution for Pakistan. The 1935\nAct was adopted as the interim constitution with some amendments. He declared Karachi as\nthe Capital of Pakistan. There he set up the first Civil Secretariat, and urged the civil servants\nto dedicate their lives to the service of the nation. He inaugurated the headquarters of three\narmed forces, and negotiated with India for the release of military and financial assets for the\ndefence of Pakistan. An ordinance factory, the POF, was set up in Wah. In order to highlight\nPakistan’s peaceful aims, Pakistan joined the UNO in September 1947. Jinnah wanted\npeaceful relations with India just like the US-Canada relations.\nHowever, it is to be noted that Jinnah retained the executive powers which, according\nto the parliamentary form of government, should have been relegated to the PM. He used to\nchair the cabinet meetings, and take important decisions himself. This was used as a wrong\nprecedent by the future Governor Generals. The process of constitution making was lingered\non even after his death as he had to induct some non-political figures in the cabinet due to a\nshortage of genuine politicians. His dream of good relations with India was also shattered\nand both countries had their first war in 1948. However, due to his failing health, other\nproblems of partition created by India, and a lack of sincere and experienced constitutional\nexperts, there was no progress on constitution making.\nJinnah inaugurated the State Bank of Pakistan in July 1948 so that Pakistan\nintroduced its own currency. The Government of Pakistan presented its first budget in 1948-\n49. It was a balanced budget which indicated Pakistan’s stable economic conditions. He also\nannounced the First Industrial Policy of Pakistan. However, despite his best efforts, there was\nno major industrial development till the 1960’s. India gave 700 million rupees to Pakistan but\nthe remaining 50 million were never paid.\n\n\nThe Quaid was opposed to religious intolerance, provincialism and racialism. He\nadvised the people to think, feel and act as Pakistanis and be proud of it. He toured all the\nareas of Pakistan to spread the message of Pakistani nationalism. In order to safeguard the\nrights of the minorities, and project Pakistan as a tolerant state he adopted the symbolic title\nof the ‘Protector-General’ of religious minorities. His advice was often sought by the non-\nMuslims, and he inducted a Hindu minister in the cabinet. He emphasized the Islamic ideas\nabout justice and equality demanded that any non-Muslims who chose to remain in Pakistan\nshould be treated fairly. Jinnah could do little about the geographical distance of 1,000 miles\nbetween East and West Pakistan. This geographical distance would gradually become a\npolitical gulf that would lead to the separation of East Pakistan in 1971.\nTo help the newly arrived refugees he set up a Relief Fund to rehabilitate them as\nquickly as possible, and temporarily shifted his headquarter to Lahore to personally supervise\nthe process of their accommodation. Unfortunately, millions of refugees would continue to\nsuffer after his death because of shortage of the required resources. All of them could not get\nmedical care, jobs and accommodation. He also negotiated with the Indian government for\nthe Canal Water dispute, and persuaded it not to stop the water altogether. The conflict was,\nhowever, fully resolved years after his death in 1960.\nJinnah wanted to resolve the issue of the three princely states of Hyderabad,\nJunagadh and Jammu and Kashmir but could not get any success as India occupied the first\ntwo states by force and imposed a war on Pakistan for Kashmir in April 1948. Thus Jinnah’s\ndream of peaceful relations with India was shattered.\nTo conclude it may be said that Jinnah was quite successful in overcoming most of\nthe early problems because of his firm determination, political insight and strong leadership\nqualities. He made all achievements while suffering from the terminal stage of pulmonary\ntuberculosis that could not deter him from his mission.\n1948-1958\nKh.

          "answer": "All 3 had their own achievements. Liaqat Ali Khan acted as PM first with Muhammad\nAli Jinnah. Khawaja Nazam ud Din became 2nd Governor General in September, 1948\nand Laiqat Ali Khan made some achievements. His major contribution was the\npassage of the Objectives Resolution in March 1949. It was a constitutional draft that\noutlined the objectives and principles of the future constitution of Pakistan. It was\nreviewed by the Basic Principles Committee in September 1950 and the revised draft\nrecommended a bicameral legislature/parliament with both houses having equal\npowers. Urdu was kept as national language and President was to be elected by the\njoint session of the parliament. However, the religious parties declared it insufficiently\nIslamic. East Pakistan objected to equal share in the parliament as it had 10% more\npopulation than West Pakistan. It also criticized on Urdu being the only national\nlanguage because Bengali was also a developed and only language spoken\nthroughout East Pakistan.\nLiaqat Ali Khan managed to keep Pakistan’s economy growing by presenting surplus\nbudgets. Also, he implemented the PRODA (Public and Representative Officers\nDisqualification Act) in order to curtail corruption in Pakistan. However, corruption\nwould continue to bother future governments.\nLiaqat Ali Khan was able to foil a coup of about 20 military officers who were unhappy\nover the presence and influence of British officers in the Pakistan Army. In March\n1951, in the famous Rawalpindi Conspiracy case, Major Akbar Khan and fourteen\nother officers were arrested. However, in October 1951. Liaqat Ali Khan was killed in\nRawalpindi while addressing a public rally.\nMalik Ghulam Muhammad became the 3rd Governor General in Oct. 1951. He\npersuaded Khawaja Nazam ud Din to step down as Prime Minister enticing him that\nhe would enjoy more executive powers. Being an expert in financial affairs he\nintroduced the scheme of 6 Year Plan that was later changed into a 5 Year Plan. Its\naim was to make economic planning regarding agriculture, industry, power and\ntransport sectors. He set up a Planning Board in 1953 to review various developments\nschemes. A major jute processing plant was set up in 1952 in East Pakistan as a\nresult of efforts for exploring oil and gas reserves, natural gas was discovered at Sui\nin Balochistan in 1952.\nIn 1952-53 Pakistan had positive Balance of Payment (BOP) due to a huge demand\nof cotton and jute in the wake of the Korean war that caused large scale export of\nthese commodities.\nDuring the same period, however, there was serious food shortage due to severe\ndrought in East and West Pakistan. This caused unrest and violence that was\naggravated by an anti-Qadiani movement. Religious parties demanded removal of\nQadinis /Ahmadis from key posts including the foreign minister Sir Zafar ullah Khan,\nMalik Ghulam Muhammad dismissed Khawaja Nazam ud Din in April 1953 on his\nfailure to control the crisis.\n\n\nMuhammad Ali Bogra, the new PM, worked on constitution making. He was ready to\nimplement the constitution in December 1954. A clause about restricting the powers\nof the Governor General was passed in just 15 minutes in the absence of Malik\nGhulam Muhammad. PRODA was also abolished as G.G could misuse it. When\nM.G.Muhammad came to know about this he quickly acted and dismissed Bogra’s\ngovernment and dissolved the Constituent Assembly in September 1954. The new\nConstituent Assembly was elected in June 1955. In August 1955 M.G. Muhammad\nfell ill and Iskandar Mirza became the new Governor General.\nMizra, a retired military general, took bold steps. First he dismissed Bogra and\nappointed Ch. Muhammad Ali as new P.M. Ch. M. Ali drafted Pakistan’s first\nConstitution that was implemented in March 1956. It introduced federal, parliamentary\nform of government though the President had powers to appoint and dismiss the P.M.\nUnder the One Unit Scheme, East and West Pakistan had equal seats in the one\nhouse parliament, the National Assembly. However, the Constitution was abrogated\nin Oct.,1958 by Mirza himself.\nThe One Unit Scheme, introduced in Oct.,1955 was aimed at unity by merging\ntogether all provinces of West Pakistan to make two provinces East and West\nPakistan. It, however was bitterly opposed by E. Pakistan and smaller provinces of\nW. Pakistan\nMirza also started some industrialization and development plans as well as rural\ndevelopment schemes. Karachi airport was completed, railways were modernized\nand telephone network was expanded. Steps were taken for provision of health and\neducation.\nMirza failed to have good relations with his Prime Ministers and dismissed them at\nshort intervals. Ch. M. Ali was replaced by Hussain Shaheed Suharwardy in\nSept.,1956. Suharwardy was replaced by I.I. Chundrigar in Oct.,1957 who himself\nwas dismissed in Dec.,1957. Malik Feroze Khan Noon was the last civilian P.M. under\nMirza from Dec.,1957 to 7th October, 1958. Finally, on 7th Oct., 1958 he declared\nMartial Law and appointed General Ayub Khan as the CMLA (Chief Marital Law\nAdministrator).\nIn conclusion, Liaqat Ali Khan seems to be the most successful as he took first step\ntowards political and economic stability of Pakistan. The Objectives Resolution of\nMarch 1949 remains the preamble of the 1973 Constitution till today.",

Murder of\nLiaqat Ali Khan in 1951 worsened the political conditions as the newly created state\nof Pakistan lost the two most experienced leaders and the country went in the hands\nof inexperienced and selfish politicians like Malik Ghulam Muhammad and Iskander\nMirza. Due to their flawed policies, there was political instability and uncertainty\nbetween 1951 and 1958. Several prime ministers were dismissed and the first\nConstituent Assembly was dissolved by Malik Ghulam Muhammad in September\n1954.\nThe Indian government was bent upon creating difficulties for Pakistan. It continued\nto delay the release of Pakistan’s share of assets and announce the accession of the\nState of Kashmir to Pakistan. It imposed a war on Pakistan in 1948 as a result of\nwhich Pakistan was forced to pay more attention on its defence instead of building a\nstrong political foundation. The Indian PM Mr Nehru never fulfilled the promise of\nholding a plebiscite in Kashmir in the 1950s which led to failed relations between the\ntwo states. India closed the two headworks in the Indian Punjab that supplied water\nto Pakistan and this added to the problems of Pakistan throughout the 1950s.\nEast Pakistan wanted a share in the government according to its population size that\nwas 10% greater than that of West Pakistan but it was given equal seats in the\nNational Assembly under the undemocratic One Unit Scheme and the rule of parity.\nWest Pakistan dominated the political affairs with Karachi as the capital and the\nheadquarters of the armed forces located in its territory.

Differences between West and East Pakistan grew as the\nlatter wanted a share in the government according to its population size that was 10%\ngreater than that of West Pakistan but it was given equal seats in the National\nAssembly under the undemocratic One Unit Scheme and the rule of parity. West\nPakistan’s dominance over the political affairs was strongly resented by East Pakistan\nas it was already backward economically.\nThe 1956 Constitution empowered the President to nominate and dismiss the Prime\nMinister. President Iskander Mirza terminated as many as four governments between\n1955 and 1958 as a result of which he began to lose popularity and power. PM\nHussain Shaheed Suharwardy gave very tough time to Mirza by uniting the major\npolitical leaders of Punjab and Bengal against him. He challenged Mirza to hold a vote\nin the Assembly to test his popularity. Mirza feared a defeat and, therefore, decided\nto declare martial law on 7th October 1958 and appointed General Ayub Khan as the\nCMLA (Chief Martial Law Administrator).\nAyub was appointed Prime Minister by Mirza on 24th October 1958. Ayub had already\ndeclined an offer from Ghulam Muhammad to take over the country as its executive\nhead. Now he could see the nominal powers of Mirza who was holding his post\nforcefully. Therefore, Ayub decided to assume power himself. He removed Mirza from\noffice and himself became the executive head of state on 27th October 1958.\n\n\n1958-1969\nAyub Khan Oct 1958 – March 1969\nIntroduction:\n 7 oct 1958, 1st martial law on Pakistan by Iskandar Mirza → General Ayub as CMLA\n(Chief Martial Law Administrator ) → all assemblies were dissolved, the 1956\nconstitution was abrogated\n 27 Oct 1958, I.Mirza was removed & all powers with Ayub → 27 Oct 1958 → Glorious\nRevolution\n 27 Oct 1958 → Justice Munir of Supreme Court validated the martial law.\n Ayub started a number of reforms.\nPolitical Reforms\n Why → Ayub opposed parliamentary democracy → “ a luxury that Pakistan couldn’t\nafford”\n Believed in some kind of “ controlled democracy” or “democrary with discipline”\n Political instability b/w 1951 & 1958\n Believed in the Presidential form of government.\nDetails:\n27 Oct 1959 → Basic Democracies Ordinance\n Basic Democracy → a four tier structure of elected & nominated/official bodies\n(1) Local Committees → (a) Union Councils and (b) Tehsil Councils, elected by\nordinary people\n(2) (a) District & (b) Divisional Council elected by the local committees, run jointly by\nthe civil servants (District & Divisional Commissioners) and the elected councils.\n Also, a Co-ordination Committee to Co-ordinate b/w Local & District Councils\n Two Provincial Development Advisory Councils (PDAC) to co-ordinate b/w the\nprovincial governors & Divisional Councils.\n All these councils to supervise local development schemes e.g. sanitation, health,\neducation, roads, raising taxes.\n Elected members of Local Committees were called BD’s (Basic Democrats).\n Vote of confidence by BD’s, 1959 → more than 90% supported Ayub.\n 120,000 BD’s from E & W Pakistan, 1st elections, Dec 1959-Jan 1960.\n BD’s formed Electoral College to elect NA that, in turn, elected the President.\n Shifted capital from Karachi to Islamabad.\nThe 1962 Constitution\n No constitution since Oct 1958\n New Constituent Commission drafted the 1962 Constitution; adopted without debate\nby NA (National Assembly), 1 March, 1962.\nMain Features\n Presidential form of govt → President could be removed only by an impeachment\nmotion of NA\n One house of parliament → NA, with equal seats of E &W Pak\n President nominated: the cabinet from NA; provincial governors & the heads of\njudiciary\n\n\n NA to make all laws with President’s approval → even ¾th majority of NA couldn’t\nforce him to approve a law he didn’t like.\n If President from W, the speaker NA to be from E.

Pakistan not happy with equal seats in NA, unusual powers of the President, who\nwas from W.Pakistan\n E. Pakistan felt being ruled by Civil & Military establishment of W. Pakistan.\n Elections for President, Jan 1965 → Ayub’s Conventional Muslim League → 64%;\ncombined opposition under Fatima Jinnah→ 36% Ayub began to lose popularity\nAgricultural Reforms\nWhy →\n Need of increased productivity & yield for a rapidly growing population\n Need of modernization of agriculture\n Unfair distribution of land → V.large land holdings with powerful land owners &\nfragmented holdings with several poor farmers.\nDetails →\n Land reforms , 1959 → no farm to be smaller than 12.5 acres: land ceiling: not larger\nthan 500 acres of irrigated & 1000 acres of unirrigated land holdings\n Redistribution of fragmented holdings to make larger holding by joining; owners of big\nholdings were forced to find tenants for parts of their lands.\n Modern methods → HYV/GM seeds, mechanization, chemical fertilizers,\ninsecticides/pesticides etc\n IWT 1960→ dams, barrages, canals for irrigation\n Loans to farmers to build tube wells.\nResults:\n Increased land productivity & crop yield\n Ayub named these reforms a ‘Green Revolution’\n Poor success rate of land reforms due to strong social position of big landowners\n Modern methods (machinery etc) were affordable by rich farmers only → economic\ndisparity b/w rich & poor farmers, in the long run\nIndustrial Reforms\nWhy →\n Poor industrial base since 1947\n Availability of funds from : sale of agricultureal output, donor countries e.g. USA, UK,\nGermany\n\n\n Economic advisors, esp those from the Harvard University\nDetails →\n Encouraged private sector for manufacturing industries by incentives→ Export Bonus\nScheme, tax holiday, stable policies, abolition of Business Profit Tax\n Borrowed loans from the West\n Oil refinery, Karachi, 1962-RCD with the Iran & Turkey to promote mutual trade &\neconomic ties, in 1964\n PMDC (Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation) for exploration & exploitation of\nMinerals\n 2nd Five year plan for economic development ( 1960-65)\nResults →\n Immediate results quite impressive→ 7% annual growth rate ( thrice that of India),\n14% increase in per capita income\n Industrial growth\n Long term→ undue concentration of wealth in few hands→22 families owned 66%\nindustries & 80% of banking & insurance\n All from W.Pakistan\n High economic disparity b/w E & W Pak & within W.Pak as most schemes were\nlaunched in W.Pak.\n Dependence on foreign aid increased → it would have long term serious\nconsequences in later years\nSocial Reforms\nWhy→ to improve literacy, health care; to reform civil laws; to control high population growth\nrate. Details→\n Free, compulsory primary education→ new schools & colleges; technical education\ninstitutes; new hospitals, medical colleges; family Planning programs; new Family\nLaws→ registration of marriage/ divorce; nursing training schools\n Revised curriculum & text books\n Housing Schemes in Karachi for the refugees, under General Azam.\nResults →\n Mix of success & failure → better health & education care, though literacy didn’t\nimprove a lot.\n Religious scholars opposed Family Planning & Family Laws\nSuccess in providing houses to the shelterless.\nFall of Ayub Khan\n 2nd Indo-Pak war, 1965, over the Kashmir issue\n Ayub’s presumption of liberating Kashmir but neither country was victorious\n Ayub’s false claim of victory → the Tashkent Accord exposed the truth & the nation\nfelt betrayed & shocked\n Ayub sacked foreign minister Z.A.Bhutto whom he blamed for the failure of the war\n Political unrest → Z.A.Bhutto emerged as the main opposition leader, formed his own\nparty → the PPP & mobilized masses against Ayub\n Strikes, arrests but violence grew\n Combined opposition – DAC (Democratic Action Committee)\n Thousands of BD’s resigned\n\n\n Unpopularity of all reforms\n Feb 1969 → lifted emergency to negotiate with the DAC, but too late\n 25 March 1969→ resigned & handed power to Gen Yahya Khan→ 2nd martial law.\n\n\nAyub Khan",

          "question": "Why were the years 1958 to 1969 called the ‘Decade of Progress’?\n(7)",
          "answer": "Ayub started many economic development projects. He hired economists and\nadvisers, many of whom had been trained in the Harvard University, the USA. He got\nhuge amounts of foreign aid that was used to stimulate industrialization. He offered\nseveral incentives to the private sectors that included concession in taxes, tax holiday\nand the Export Bonus Scheme. These measures attracted a great number of\nindustrialists and the large scale manufacturing industry grew rapidly. During the\nSecond Five Year Plan (1960-1965), manufacturing output grew at an annual average\nrate of around 11.5%. During this period people’s incomes went up by an average of\n14%. As a result, Pakistan achieved a very high economic growth rate of 7% that was\nthrice that of India.\nAyub’s agricultural reforms are rightly called the Green Revolution. He introduced\nmodernization of agriculture. Tractors with other machines, HYV (High Yield Variety)\nseeds, chemical fertilizers and insecticides and pesticides were used to maximize\nagricultural output. Under the IWT (Indus Water Treaty) 1960, Pakistan was funded\nto build large dams and barrages. Thus water for irrigation and power production was\nstored on large scale and output of major crops increased significantly.\nHis social reforms were also very popular. In order to provide better health care, new\nmedical colleges and hospitals were setup. Attempts were made to control a high\npopulation growth rate through a family planning programme. He tried to raise the\nliteracy rate by encouraging primary education, and set up polytechnic institutes to\nprepare a trained industrial workforce. Though most of the benefits of these reforms\nwent to West Pakistan, Ayub was able to deflect criticism be celebrating the Decade\nof Development in 1968.\n\n\nQ “Agricultural reforms were the most important of Ayub Khan’s\ndomestic policies.” Do you agree or disagree?

          "question": "Why was Islamabad chosen as the new capital of Pakistan? (7)",
          "answer": "Islamabad was located at a better place. Ayub wanted to be closer to the army’s\ncommand headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi in the northern Punjab which he\nconsidered vital in times of martial law. Also, he got closer to Punjab and the NWFP\n(KPK) that provided bulk of troops for the armed forces of Pakistan. He could see a\nvisible influence of the commercial districts of Karachi on many of the government\nofficials. Many of them had started taking interest in trade instead of their official\nduties. Development of Karachi as the port and the capital city had left northern\nPakistan relatively under developed. Ayub wanted to shift the power base from the\nindustrially and commercially developed south to the Punjab in the north.\nKarachi has a warm and humid climate whereas Islamabad was located at the\nMargalla hills near Murree with a pleasant climate suitable for working. It was an\nabandoned place where it was easier to build a planned city with a desired layout.\nKarachi had become overburdened with a growth of buildings and population due to\nlarge scale influx of refugees from India and rural-urban migration. The existing state\nbuildings in Karachi were not adequate to meet the needs of a modern capital.\nKarachi’s location on the Indus Delta Coast made it vulnerable to attacks by the Indian\nnavy. In such a case, there was a fear of huge cost of reconstruction if it was destroyed\nby the Indians in case of a war. Islamabad, being a land locked city, was at a\nreasonable distance from the Pak-India border and was a much better option.\nTherefore, construction work was continued in the 1960s and the capital was officially\nshifted to Islamabad in 1967.",

          "question": "Why did Ayub Khan fall from power? (7)",
          "answer": "Ayub had become unpopular by 1969. His agricultural reforms had created huge\ndisparity between the rich and the poor farmers. As a result of his industrial reforms,\nonly 22 families of West Pakistan became owners of 66% of Pakistan’s industries and\n80% of banking and insurance companies. People were angry on the celebration of\nthe Decade of Development from 27th October 1967 to 27th October 1968 in which\nmillions of rupees were spent while there was large scale unemployment. East\nPakistan also felt frustrated as most of the beneficiaries of Ayub’s reforms were from\nWest Pakistan. Moreover, East Pakistan complained of being left unguarded in the\n1965 Pak-India war.\nHis political reforms also became target of criticism as he was accused of intimidation\nand vote-rigging in the second presidential elections that were held in January 1965.\nIn these, Fatimah Jinnah managed to get about 36% votes against Ayub Khan.\nConcentration of powers with the president was considered undemocratic as the\nNational Assembly could not pass any law without his consent. Most of his Basic\nDemocrats had resigned by the start of 1969.\nAyub especially became unpopular after the 1965 Pak-India war. He felt he had to\naccept a humiliating ceasefire against the advice of his foreign minister Z. A. Bhutto.\nAyub had been assuring his people of Pakistan’s victory in the war but the Tashkent\nAccord of 1966 contained no reference to this or the Kashmir issue. Bhutto resigned\nin protest and founded the PPP/Pakistan People’s Party in 1967. Being a very\ncharismatic leader, he mobilized masses and launched an anti-Ayub campaign. In\nJanuary 1969 eight political parties formed the Democratic Action Committee and\ndemanded general elections. Ayub’s failure to negotiate with them ended in his\nresignation on 25th March 1969.",

          "question": "How successful was Ayub Khan in improving Pakistan’s relations with\nother states during his rule? [10]",
          "answer": "Ayub was quite successful in his foreign affairs. Though he had offended the\nAmericans by visiting China and the USSR/Soviet Union in the early 1960s, he was able to\nmaintain friendly relations with the USA. He allowed the US to build air bases in Pakistan and\nremained loyal to the US during the Pak-USSR conflict over the U-2 crisis. 1966 onwards the\nUS aid to Pakistan was restored. Ayub paid a historic visit to Washington in July 1961. The\nUS President J.F. Kenedy hosted a dinner in the White House tht was attended by 140\nguests. It is described as the most dramatic and the most famous state dinner in White House\nhistory. In return Mrs J.F. Kenedy paid a visit to Pakistan in 1963, and was given Ayub’s\nfavourite horse Sardar. When Ayub fell from power, the US was quite concerned over the\nrise of a socialist-minded Z.A.Bhutto. Pakistan protested when the US extended military aid\nto India in the India-China war, in September 1962. Ayub argued that the US should at least\nhave consulted Pakistan before extending aid to India. He also argued that the Americans\nshould have pressurized India to accept arbitration on the Kashmir issue in return for the US\naid. Pakistan felt let down when the US aid to both Pakistan and India was stopped in the\n1965 war. Ayub’s visits to China in 1962, and the USSR in 1965 also displeased the USA.\nAyub laid the foundation of Pak-USSR relations by paying a visit to Moscow in 1965\nafter the incident of the U-2 spy plane in 1960. However, in 1961 the USSR offered some oil\nexploration projects to Pakistan. Pakistan got a chance to get closer to both the USSR and\nChina in the 1962 Indo-China war. Consequently Pakistan received a Soviet aid of 11 million\npounds, and instead of supporting India over the Kashmir issue, the USSR adopted a neutral\nstance. Therefore, in April 1965, Ayub paid a visit to Moscow and signed agreements on oil\nexploration in Pakistan. In January 1966, the Soviet Union mediated a peace treaty, the\nTashkent Accord, between India and Pakistan after the 1965 war. In 1968, when the\nAmericans began to close their airbase at Peshawar, the Soviets began military aid to\nPakistan. That year Pakistan was the recipient of military aid from three mutually hostile super\npowers, the US, the USSR and China, though the USSR was not happy with Pakistan\nreceiving aid from the other two super powers. The U-2 incident greatly angered the Soviets\nin 1960. U-2 was an American spy plane that flew from the Peshawar air base, and was\ncaptured by the Soviets. The Soviet President threatened Pakistan of serious consequences\nof a similar misadventure in future. In the 1965 war, when US aid for Pakistan was stopped,\nthe Soviet aid to India greatly affected Pak-Soviet relations.\nAyub is also credited with the start of successful Pak-China relations. The Indo-China\nwar of 1962 gave Pakistan an opportunity to improve relations with China. In March 1962,\nPakistan and China began talks to settle their border dispute, and successfully settled the\nissue by March 1963. China gave many concessions to Pakistan as it wanted to counter\nIndia-USSR alliance with the help of Pakistan. In 1963, both countries signed many trade\nagreements, and China granted Pakistan an interest free loan of 60 million dollars. In August\n1963, regular PIA flights to China further improved bilateral trade. In 1964-65, China openly\nsupported Pakistan for the Kashmir issue. Pakistan, in return, supported China’s entry into\nthe UN at a time when the US was supporting the anti-communit Taiwan as the legitimate\ngovernment of China. China extended moral and material aid to Pakistan in the 1965 war\nand applied diplomatic pressure on India. 1958-1962 there had been almost no progress in\nPak-China relations mainly because of Pakistan’s heavy dependence on the US.\nPak-UK relations generally remained successful in the 1960s. Britain played a major\nrole in ending the 1965 war as both were members of the anti-communist blocs, SEATO and\nCENTO. The final agreement was signed in June 1965 at the Commonwealth Conference,\nLondon. Several Pakistanis availed the 1962 Commonwealth Immigration Act to migrate to\nthe UK. They sent heavy remittances to Pakistan while working in the UK. The Queen\n\n\nElizabeth-II visited Pakistan in 1961 as the Head of the Commonwealth. However, Ayub’s\nvisit to Moscow and Beijing somewhat worried the British authorities.\nPakistan and India signed the Indus Water Treaty in 1960 to resolve the canal water\ndispute. In 1966, they signed the Tashkent Accord after the 1965 war. Pakistan was rightly\nworried over India receiving the US aid in 1962. Both countries failed to resolve the Kashmir\nissue, and fought their second war in September 1965. India was not happy over Pakistan’s\naid from three super powers in the late 1960s.\nPakistan Iran and Turkey signed the RCD (Regional Cooperation for Development)\nin July 1964. Work was done on the RCD Highway and railway track. Many agreements were\nsigned to promote trade and cultural relations. However, Afghanistan refused to join the RCD.\nThough most of the Afghanis supported Pakistan in the 1965 war, the Afghan government\nremained neutral.\nIt may be concluded that Ayub Khan was quite successful in his foreign relations as\nhis era marked significant progress in extracting military and economic aid from the three\nsuper powers as well as with the Muslim states. The economic aid was used to initiate\nindustrial and agricultural reforms.\nSample Question\nSource A, a comment made by Quaid-e-Azam’s sister, Mohtarma Fatima\nJinnah, in an interview with the Morning News, 29 October 1958.\n“A new era has begun under General Ayub Khan and the armed forces have undertaken to\nroot out the administrative malaise and anti-social practices, to create a sense of confidence,\nsecurity and stability and eventually to bring the country back to normalcy.

Mujeeb to form govt in the centre→ Z.A.Bhutto & General\nYahya backed out their promise with Sh.Mujeeb to make him President; start of\nmilitary operation in E.Pak, March 1971 – The Operation Searchlight; Bengali\nseparatist militant organization, Mukti Bahini (People’s Army) was trained & equipped\nby Indain Army→ civil war, violence, feelings of separatism grew with military\noperation & with the rejection of Sh.Mujeeb’s six points → events escalated to 3rd\nIndo-Pak war, Dec 1971 → 1600km Indian territory b/w E & W Pak made it impossible\nfor W.Pak to win the war → 16 Dec 1971, Pak army surrendered before Indian army,\nDhakka→more than 90,000 Pak troops in Indian custody.\nReasons for Pakistan’s Defeat in the 1971 War\n E.Pak determined to resist W.Pak army that desperately tried to keep E.Bengal part\nof Pakistan →poor morale of Pak army to fight against fellow Muslims.\n 1600 km long distance b/w E & W Pak → very difficult to sustain supplies from W to\nE with Indian territory b/w the two wings.\n Poor chance of support by Pak’s allies → US & UN not interested in supporting Pak\nin its internal matters; Treaty of Peace, Friendship & Commerce, Aug 1971, b/w India\nand USSR blocked China’s possible aid to Pak → India continued to receive Soviet\naid.\n\n\nSeparation of East Pakistan",

          "question": "Why did the victory of the Awami League cause a constitutional\ncrisis? (7)",
          "answer": "The Awami League got a decisive majority in the 1970 elections. It won 160 out of a\ntotal of 162 seats of East Pakistan and 300 seats of the National Assembly against\nthe PPP of West Pakistan that managed to win only 81 seats. Such a huge victory of\nthe Awami League allowed it to form the government on its own. In other words, the\nfuture Prime Minister and his entire Cabinet could come from East Pakistan without\ninvolving the PPP of West Pakistan.\nBhutto kept all his MNAs from attending the National Assembly session scheduled to\nbe held in Dhaka. He, in February 1971, threatened to break the legs of those who\ntried to attend the session. This promoted anger among the Bengali MNAs as they\nfelt betrayed. The scheduled session of NA was thus indefinitely postponed.\nGeneral Yahya and Mr Bhutto visited Dhaka, in March 1971, and assured Sheikh\nMujeeb that he would be the future head of state. Yahya invited Mujeeb to West\nPakistan but the latter declined the offer thus losing a good opportunity to gain\npopularity in West Pakistan.\nVictory of the Awami League was also problematic as it had won the election on the\nbasis of Mujeeb’s six points that asked for a complete internal autonomy of East\nPakistan. He wanted provincial governments controlling foreign trade and taxation\n\n\npolicy. This would greatly reduce the funds available to the central government in\nWest Pakistan in addition to limiting its powers in general. Yahya Khan and the West\nPakistani politicians were not prepared to accept such a major change though Mujeeb\nbelieved that the six points were negotiable. Instead of negotiating with him, he was\narrested and this marked the start of the worst kind of constitutional crisis in the history\nof Pakistan.",

          "question": "Explain why East Pakistan wished to become independent of\nWest\nPakistan? (7)",
          "answer": "There was a growing economic disparity between East and West Pakistan. East\nPakistan had a weaker industrial base with fewer industries than West Pakistan. Its\neconomy was further weakened by floods and cyclones that destroyed its\ninfrastructure regularly. Due to the dominance of West Pakistan, most of the economic\npolicies mainly benefited its people. This disparity increased significantly in the 1960s\nwhen 22 families of West Pakistan became owners of most of Pakistan’s wealth. By\n1970, the per capita income of East Pakistan was 85% that of West Pakistan. This\nwas resented by East Pakistan.\nEast Pakistan was under-represented in government, armed forces and the Civil\nServices though it had 55% of the total population of Pakistan. Under the One Unit\nScheme, both the wings were given equal seats in the National Assembly. When the\nAwami League of Sheikh Mujeeb won a majority in the 1970 elections, West Pakistan\nrefused to transfer power to Mujeeb. His six points directly threatened the traditional\npolitical dominance of West Pakistan. This led to a civil war in East Pakistan that\nbecame Bangladesh after West Pakistan’s defeat by India in December 1971.\nBoth wings were separated by an Indian territory of 1600 km that resulted in difficulties\nin communication between the two. In times of emergencies such as floods, West\nPakistan usually reacted slowly that inculcated a sense of alienation among Bengalis.\nAyub’s presidential form of government gave him unusual powers and this was\nconsidered undemocratic by Bengalis. For the same reason, they boycotted Ayub’s\ncelebration of the Decade of Development in 1968-1969.",

          "answer": "India was militarily superior. The 1965 war was fought on the two gross\nmiscalculations of Ayub Khan who thought India was not prepared for a full scale war.\nHe also expected a massive Kashmiri uprising in favour of Pakistan army. However,\nagainst all his expectations, India attacked with full force and Lahore was caught\nunprepared on 6th September 1965, though Pakistan defended it well.\nPakistan could not receive the Western aid in the two wars. The US military aid was\nstopped for both Pakistan and India. It affected Pakistan more as India continued to\nreceive the Soviet aid. It had blocked any chance of the US or Chinese aid to Pakistan\nby signing a strategic agreement with the USSR in August 1971. Americans and\nChinese wanted Pakistan to resolve the matter on its own. Pakistan also expected\nsome aid by the SEATO but that too was not provided.\nBy 1971, India had developed a much bigger army against Pakistan in terms of\nnumber of troops and weapons. It exploited the civil war in East Pakistan by training\nand equipping the Bengali militant separatist body, the Mukti Bahini against Pakistan.\nPeople of East Pakistan, in general, wanted freedom from West Pakistan.

          "question": "Economic factors contributed the most towards the separation of\nEast Pakistan in 1971. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for\nyour answer. (14)",
          "answer": "Economic disparity between East and West Pakistan grew with time. East Pakistan\nhad been poorer than West Pakistan since 1947 as its weak industrial base was\nrepeatedly damaged by floods. Unfortunately, this gap was widened mainly due to the\neconomic policies of Ayub Khan in the 1960s. West Pakistan became the major\nbeneficiary of his industrial and agricultural reforms. The 22 richest families of West\nPakistan owned 66% of the industries and 80% of banking and insurance companies\nof Pakistan. East Pakistan was the largest producer of jute in the world (producing\n75% of the total world jute) but its economic growth was slower than that of West\nPakistan. Earnings from the jute export and taxes collected from East Pakistan were\nmainly spent on the development of West Pakistan. The per capita income of East\nPakistan was 85% that of West Pakistan by 1970. This means that every West\nPakistani was 15% richer then his East Pakistani counterpart on the average. The\nBengalis also questioned the justification of spending of the Kashmir issue while\nkeeping East Pakistan under developed. All this promoted a sense of deprivation and\nfrustration among the people of East Pakistan.\nPolitical factors also contributed to the separation of East Pakistan. It wanted a share\nin the government according to the size of the population that was 10% greater than\nWest Pakistan (55% of the total population). This was denied to them under the One\nUnit Scheme and rule of parity as enforced in the 1956 and 1962 Constitutions. Most\nof the political decision making was done in West Pakistan. East Pakistan was under-\nrepresented in the armed forces and the Civil Services as the headquarters of the\narmed forces were located in West Pakistan.\n\n\nThe Awami League of Sheikh Mujeeb in East Pakistan won an overall majority in the\n1970 elections. Mujeeb got this victory on the basis of his six points that asked for full\nautonomy of East Pakistan in all matters except for defence and foreign affairs.\nMujeeb wanted separate fiscal, taxation and foreign trade policy of the two wings\nwhich West Pakistan could not accept as it would weaken its traditional dominance in\npolitics and economy. Mujeeb was denied power and arrested that led to a civil war\nin East Pakistan. Situation worsened as General Yahya ordered a military operation\nin March 1971. There was massacre of Bengalis who retaliated with the help of India.\nThe Indian army had been training and funding the Mukti Bahini, the militant Bengali\nseparatist army. Finally, the 1971 war led to West Pakistan’s defeat and creation of\nBangladesh.\nCultural factors also contributed towards the tragic separation of East Pakistan.\nJinnah declared Urdu as the only national language on the basis of “One Nation One\nLanguage”. This was resented by East Pakistan as Bengali was a fully developed and\nthe only language spoken throughout East Pakistan. The Bengalis took this as a step\nof West Pakistan’s attempts to dominate them. After protests and violence, Bengali\nwas also declared as the national language with Urdu.\nEast and West Pakistan were separated by a 1600 km long Indian territory and this\ncaused difficulties in communication between the two wings. East Pakistan was\nregularly ravaged by floods and cyclones that further weakened its economy. Failure\nof West Pakistan to provide timely help in such emergencies also promoted a sense\nof separatism in East Pakistan. It was affected by devastating floods only a couple of\nmonths before the 1970 elections but West Pakistan did not show any concern in\nproviding relief to the flood victims. India offered aid ostensibly on humanitarian\ngrounds but West Pakistan did not allow it and this further hurt the people of East\nPakistan.\nIt may be concluded that economic factors contributed the most towards the\nseparation of East Pakistan. With a growing economic disparity and political\ndominance of West Pakistan, East Pakistan felt that it was continuously being\nexploited by West Pakistan. This situation was viewed by Bengalis as a continuation\nof the colonial rule on them even after independence.\n\n\nZ.A.

Profits from the nationalized companies\nwere to be spent on improving public services such as health and education.\nHe wanted to promote economic growth and bring inflation down from a high level of\n25%. By nationalizing industrial units the government could control industrial output\nand channel the profits and investment into industrialization. This way the popularity\nof his party, the PPP, was also expected to increase with the urban populace that was\nan important sector of the party’s support.\nHe also wanted to even out the inequalities resulting from Ayub’s industrial reforms\nof the 1960s. These reforms had benefitted only some people, the famous 22 families\nthat had become owner of about 80% of Pakistan’s large scale industry.

Capable factory owners were\noften replaced by civil servants with little understanding of commerce and civil\nservices were already notorious for their inefficiency. Moreover, Pakistan’s education\nsystem was not yet producing sufficiently educated workers to take managerial\npositions in the industries under the Federal Ministry of Production.\nThe Federal Ministry had a huge job to do for co-ordinating the nationalization process\nacross the country. It was a time taking process and needed a hurdle free working\nenvironment but unfortunately, it was often got bogged down in bureaucratic muddle.\nThe changes took place at a time when the world was going through an economic\nrecession that had lowered the demand of various products of industries. The newly\nnationalized industries, therefore, could not improve their output in such conditions.\nForeign and some well-off Pakistanis, who did not like the socialist policies, shifted\ntheir units out of Pakistan and invested elsewhere.

Due to nationalization of schools,\nthere was a drop in the standard of education as they were over-burdened and could\nnot cater to the increased number of students without an increase in the trained staff.\nIn many places there was a lack of teaching, teacher training and administrative staff.\nThe government had allocated only 13% of the education budget to primary schools.\nWith such a small amount of funds the desired results could not be achieved.\nImproving literacy rate and educational standard is a time taking process. It is not\npossible to change the curriculum, trained teachers and develop the educational\ninfrastructure in a short time. As a result, there was only 1% increase in literacy even\nafter 5 years.\nMost of the rural families were not interested in the formal education or literacy. They\nusually preferred to make their children work on the farm and thus share the economic\nburden of the family. They could not afford the loss of earnings even if they were\noffered free education.

          "question": "Constitutional reforms were the most important of Zulfiqar Ali\nBhutto’s domestic policies between 1971 and 1977’. Do you agree\nor disagree? Give reasons for your answer. (14)",
          "answer": "Z.A Bhutto’s constitutional reforms were very successful. He assumed power amidst\nvery critical circumstances. East Pakistan had become Bangladesh and there was no\nconstitution since March 1969. Z.A Bhutto headed the last Constituent Assembly that\ncomprised members elected in the 1970 elections. It began the tasking of framing a\nnew constitution. The new constitution was implemented on 14th August, 1973. It\nintroduced pure parliamentary form of government with the P.M the executive head\nwhile the President only a figure head of state. A bicameral parliament was\nintroduced. The National Assembly, (the lower house), had members in proportion to\nthe population of each province. The Senate, (upper house), had equal number of\nseats from each province, giving protection to the smaller provinces. Senators were\nacademics, professionals and technocrats.\nThe Constitution was criticized by the opposition because the focal point of political\npower lay with the party leadership (Bhutto remained chairman of PPP till the end of\nhis rule). Bhutto became autocratic and authoritarian with time, and when political\nmatters worsened, all blame was put on him.\nHis other domestic reforms were also important. In order to improve literacy and\nensure a uniform standard of education, most of the private sector schools were\nnationalized. Primary education was made free and compulsory. New Schools were\nopened and the old ones were upgraded. These policies had little success due to lack\nof funds, trained teachers and school buildings. Parents in rural areas opposed formal\neducation as it did not guarantee jobs for their children. Also , the funds allocated for\nprimary education were only 13% of the total budget for education.\nTo provide health care to all, and to improve life expectancy and infant mortality rate\n(IMR) several BHU’s (Basic Health Units) and RHU’s (Rural Health Centres) were set\n\n\nup. New medical colleges and hospitals were set up. Under the new drug policy, brand\nnames of drugs were abolished, so that medicines were available at cheaper prices.\nThis, however, resulted in declining earning of chemists and many pharmaceutical\ncompanies closed their business in Pakistan.\nBhutto was inspired by communism and socialism with an aim of ensuring control of\nthe government on sources of production and to improve the standard of living of\nindustrial workers. Most of the large scale industries were nationalized, only cotton\ntextile sector was spared. To finance these industrial units, five commercial banks\nwere also nationalized. Industrial growth slowed down as the nationalized units were\ngiven to civil servants who were not trained for the job. However, many industries\nsurvived at the time of world-wide economic crises when many industrialists were\nabout to close down their units.\n\n\nBhutto had a strong vote bank of industrial workers and farmers. Since Ayub’s Green\nRevolution had increased the land productivity but had also caused huge disparity\nbetween rich and poor farmers, Bhutto lowered the land ceiling to 500 acres of un-\nirrigated and 250 acres irrigated land holdings, it was further reduced to 300 and 150\nacres respectively. Through the Tenant Safety Act he provided protection to tenant\ncultivators who couldn’t be evicted without a valid reason. These measures increased\nhis popularity but their success rate was poor due to the strong social position of the\nrich land owners (zamindars) many of whom were, ironically, members of the\nParliament.\nIt can be proved that Bhutto was most successful in his constitutional reforms because\nthe 1973 Constitution continues to survive till today, despite being suspended by two\nmilitary rulers in 1977 and 1999. This shows the inherent strength of the Constitution\nand the ability of Bhutto to give a lasting constitution to the people of Pakistan.",

          "question": "How successful was Z.A. Bhutto in his foreign policy in the 1970s?\n[10]",
          "answer": "Bhutto improved relations mainly with the USSR, China and the Muslim world. So, he\nfailed to have friendly relations with the West. Bhutto paid two visits to Washington to keep\ncordial relations with the USA. However, the US were unhappy over his friendly relations with\nthe USSR and China. Therefore, there was no significant progress in Pakistan’s relations\nwith the US, UK and the Commonwealth. Bhutto left both the Commonwealth and SEATO\nwhen Great Britain recognized Bangladesh in 1971 as it reflected the British neutrality in\nfavour of India. After the 1971 war, Bhutto visited Moscow in 1972 and accepted the soviet\noffer of building a steel mill in Pakistan. Accordingly, the PSM (Pakistan Steel Mill) was\nestablished with the Soviet aid in the 1970s. Pak-Soviet relations remained stronger till the\ndownfall of Bhutto in July 1977.\nChina had remained neutral in the 1971 Indo-Pak war. After the war China again\nbegan to support Pakistan openly. Bhutto visited China in February 1972. China agreed to\nconvert all previous loans into grants, and supplied military aircrafts and tanks. Pakistan’s\nsecond iron industry, HMC (Heavy Mechanical Complex), Taxila was set up with the Chinese\nassistance.\nBhutto convened the second summit of the OIC in Lahore in February 1974 in which\nPakistan recognized Bangladesh as an independent republic. Bhutto signed several\nagreements with the rich Muslim states of the Middle East. Within two years Pakistan was\nreceiving heavy aid from many Muslim countries. Iran gave loans of 730 million dollars, the\nUAE 100 million dollars and Lybia 80 million dollars. Bhutto offered friendly relations to the\nAfghan President. In 1976, Bhutto and the Afghan President Sardar Daud exchanged many\nvisits in which the Shah of Iran played a key role. Attempts were made to sign the APTTA\n(Afghan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement) to help Afghanistan avail Pakistan’s port.\nHowever, Afghanistan’s rigidity over the Pakhtoonistan issue and refusing to accept the\nDurand Line as an international Pak-Afghan border halted all efforts to improve bilateral\nrelations. The RCD remained a very effective bloc during Bhutto’s regime.\nBhutto visited India in July 1972 and signed the Simla Agreement with the Indian PM\nMrs Indira Gandhi. India agreed to release about 90,000 Pakistani POWs (Prisoners of War)\nthat had been in its custody since December 1970. Both Prime Ministers agreed to resolve\nall mutual disputes without involvement of a third party (e.g. the UN). India, however, tested\nits first nuclear weapons in Rajasthan desert in 1974. Feeling insecure, Bhutto retaliated by\n\n\ndeclaring that Pakistan would also develop nuclear technology. This adversely affected the\nPak-India relations.\nZ.A. Bhutto was perhaps quite successful in his foreign policy as Pakistan built first\never two large scale iron and steel industries in its history. Moreover, Pakistan was\nrecongnized as a very important Muslim state in the world.\n\n\nSample Question\nSource A,\nPart of a speech of Z.A.

diplomats abroad were from military in 1982.\n Tried to develop a political base → Majlis-i-Shoora ( Islamic Parliament) to advise Zia\nabout Islamic law → an advisory body, no legislative power\n 1984, referendum on the pretext of continuing Islamic reforms as president for another\n5 yrs.\n Poor turn out → 10% due to boycott of the combined opposition, MRD (Movement of\nRestoration of Democracy) → referendum proved a failure → he was no more\npopular.\n 1985 elections → non-party basis\n MRD protested, tried to keep people away form elections but Zia was firm\n Before elections, many amendments in the constitution to legalise all his steps &\nstrengthen his authority.\n Elections, March 1985 → 52% turn out →big landlords & tribal chiefs were elected\ndespite the boycott by

This made Pakistan\na vital ally of the US, and Zia a leader of a Muslim state on the frontline against the Soviet\ncommunist forces. The US and the Western Europe extended huge financial and military aid\nto Pakistan. Military aid was given to help the Afghan Mujahideen whereas the purpose of\nthe economic aid was to enable Pakistan to accommodate millions of Afghan refugees. Zia\nwas able to use some of these funds for the economic growth of Pakistan by starting several\n\n\ndevelopment projects. This way the Soviet attack on Afghanistan became a miracle for Zia’s\nmilitary rule.",

          "question": "Why did Zia introduce his package of Islamic laws between 1979\nand 1988? (7)",
          "answer": "He wanted to justify his rule. Since he had toppled the elected government of Z.A.\nBhutto, he had to ensure a strong and stable government managed by people committed to\nIslamic teachings. He enforced a strict Islamic legal code named the Hudood and Qazaf\nOrdinance, so that the people of Pakistan would not object to his ignoring of the political\nprocess. This way he could undo the image of Bhutto and prove that his government was un-\nIslamic.\nHe planned to prove that Pakistan had been created in the name of Islam, and\ntherefore, people should live according to the Islamic teachings. So, he introduced Islamic\neducation like compulsory teaching of Islamiyat in schools and colleges. In order to make\nsure that people showed due respect to the Holy Prophet, he enforced the Blasphemy Law\nunder which strict punishments were given to those showing disrespect to the Holy Quran\nand the Holy Prophet.\nHe wanted to make Pakistan a truly Islamic welfare state where needs of the poor\nand the unsupported were satisfied by the government according to the financial teachings\nof Islam. In order to achieve this, he promulgated the Zakat and ’Ushr Ordinance under which\nZakat was deducted from the public savings deposited in the banks, in addition to being\ncollected by the Zakat Committees.",

          "answer": "There was a serious breakdown of law and order during the late 1980s. Sindh, with\nKarachi as the largest city of Pakistan, became a victim of violence, sectarian riots, kidnap\nfor ransom and drug trafficking. Arrival of the Afghan refugees facilitated the availability of\nweapons and drugs like heroin. The MQM (Muhajir/now Muttahida Qaumi Movement)\nemerged as a popular party in urban areas of Sindh. It represented the Urdu speaking\nmigrants from India and it went into a clash with the Sindhi speaking population. There were\nseveral incidents of communal violence in Karachi and Hyderabad.\nZia’s strict Islamic reforms resulted in sectarian differences leading to armed clashes\nbetween the Sunni and the Shi’a community of Pakistan. Extremist religious organizations\n\n\ngot weapons to fight against the rival groups. Jhang, a city in Punjab, began to breed many\nextremist organizations. The NWFP (now KPK) had also developed differences with the\ncentral government of Zia over his plans of building the Kalabagh Dam.\nIn April 1988, the explosion at the Ojhri Camp in Rawalpindi caused deaths of several\ninnocent people, and the PM Mr. Junejo announced to conduct a transparent inquiry of the\ntragedy. This created a serious difficulty for Zia as he feared inclusion of top military officers\nin the inquiry. He could not afford the loss of military support, and therefore, dismissed\nJunijo’s government in May 1988. This worsened the political crisis for Zia.",

          "question": "Economic reforms were the most important of Zia ul Haq’s\ndomestic policies between 1977 and 1988. Do you agree? Give\nreasons for your\nanswer. (14)",
          "answer": "Zia ensured a strict and stable regime. In order to win the confidence of the investors,\nhe renounced Bhutto’s policy of nationalisation. Industrial units were returned to their owners.\nThe industrial growth began to improve. Moreover, millions of overseas Pakistanis began to\nsend heavy remittances that were spent on several development schemes. From the Middle\nEast alone $ 4billion were sent every year by the Pakistani workers. Also, Pakistan became\nthe greatest beneficiary of the ‘Afghan Miracle’. After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in\nDecember 1979, Pakistan became the frontline state to counter the Soviets in Afghanistan.\nIt received heavy US aid for many years. Pakistan was given soft term loans and aid of $ 1.6\nbillion, £ 1.5 billion and then $ 4.2 billion military and economic aid between 1980 and 1986.\nPakistan’s GNP (Gross National Product) was 6.2% in three years.\nThis impressive economic growth rate, however, was accompanied by inflation, an\nincreased power consumption and loss of skilled workers to other countries. Since no new\npower plants were set up, Pakistanis had to experience load shedding. Easy availability of\ndrugs and weapons led to drug addiction and violence in the country.\nZia also introduced Islamic reforms as he wanted a strong and stable government and\nundo the image of Z.A. Bhutto. He also wanted to endorse the popular belief that Pakistan\nwas created in the name of Islam. Accordingly, he enforced a series of Hudood Ordinances\nin 1977. Under these, Islamic punishment were prescribed for major offences such as\nZina/adultery (100 stripes), theft (cutting off the right hand), drinking (80 stripes) and\nQazf/false accusation of adultery (80 stripes). Under the Blasphemy Law a punishment of\nimprisonment or fine or death sentence was prescribed for those found guilty of showing\ndisrespect to the Holy Prophet (PBUH). Under the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance of June 1980,\na wealth tax of 2.5% was levied on the bank savings. On the protest of the Shi’a community,\nthey were exempted from this tax. Ushr Ordinance imposed 5% tax on agricultural income\nbut it had little success. The Zakat money was distributed among the poor.\nPrograms on Radio and TV were started to promote Arabic language, and teaching\nof Islamiyat and Pak Studies was made compulsory. Extra marks were given to the\nmemorisers of the Quran in the Civil Services. Interest-based banking was replaced with the\nprofit – loss sharing banking. The Council of Islamic Ideology was created to advise the\ngovernment to make laws according to Islam. Also, the Federal Shari’at Court was created\nto examine the existing laws and Islamic theme. The Laws were strongly resisted by the\nwomen activist groups and minorities as both felt insecure under these Laws.\nZia had to legitimise his stay in power and overcome the opposition, led mainly by the\nPPP. He had suspended the 1973 constitution, and through the PCO (Provisional\nConstitutional Ordinance) he restrained all the Courts from challenging any of the decisions\nof the military rule. He appointed several military officers in civil services. In 1984 he held a\nreferendum asking people if they wanted Islamisation in Pakistan or not. With a poor\nparticipation of 10% he got elected as the President for five years. In 1985, elections were\nheld on non-party basis, and a very obedient parliament was elected. PML led leaders were\nappointed as Chief Minister (Nawaz Sharif) and Prime Minister (Muhammad Khan Junejo).\nZia restored the Constitution with the 8th amendment (article 58-2(b) that empowered him to\ndismiss the elected government and dissolve the assemblies. Thus his position was\nstrengthened till his death.\n\n\nIt may be concluded that Zia’s economic reforms were the most successful of his\ndomestic policies as they brought about prosperity on a large scale and so, common man\nhad no concern about a military ruler who had toppled a civilian govt.\nAlternative Judgement\nHis Islamisation was more successful than any of his other reforms because he was\nable to convince the people that enforcement of Sharia’ was much more important than\ndemocracy or civilian governments.",

          "question": "How successful was General Zia in his foreign policy? [10 / 14]",
          "answer": "Zia was more inclined towards the West, though the US showed little interest in Zia’s\npolicies. In November 1979, the US embassy in Islamabad was burned down. The US blamed\nZia for encouraging the angry mob. Soon, however, the situation changed in favour of Zia.\nThe Soviets/Russians invaded Afghanistan in December 1979, and Pakistan suddenly\nbecame important for the US due to its strategic location. Pakistan received heavy US military\nand economic aid to support the Afghan Mujahideen and to accommodate millions of Afghan\nrefugees. In 1981, the US President Regan gave Pakistan a package of 1.6 billion dollars for\n5 years. Then a loan of 1.5 billion pounds was to help Pakistan buy modern US weapons. In\n1986, another 4.2 billion dollars were given to Pakistan. After 1986, there were signs of the\nSoviet defeat in Afghanistan. Therefore, the US changed its behaviour towards Pakistan.\nAfter the Geneva Accord in 1988, the US and the USSR agreed on peace in Afghanistan.\nThe Soviet troops were scheduled to leave Afghanistan, and Pakistan suddenly lost its\nstrategic importance. The US had ignored Pakistan’s nuclear programme during the Afghan\nwar, but in the late 1980s the Presslar Amendment of 1985 would gradually be applied on\nPakistan. Under this, a country could receive the US aid only after the American President\ndeclared that country as non-nuclear. Pak-USSR relations were not successful in the 1980s\ndue to Pakistan’s support of the Afghan Mujahideen with the help of the US. In 1984, Zia\nvisited Moscow to attend the funeral rites of the Soviet Present Andropov, but was not\naccorded a warm welcome. The Soviet war planes dropped bombs on various Pakistani\nterritories towards the end of 1984. One of these raids resulted in 140 deaths of Pakistani\ncivilians. Hostile relations continued till the signing of the Geneva Accord in 1988.\nPak-China relations generally remained friendly during Zia’s regime. In 1978, the\nKarakoram Highway (KKH) was completed with the Chinese aid. Zia visited China in 1986,\nand a nuclear technology treaty was signed between the two countries.\nZia was able to maintain friendly relations with the UK and the Commonwealth. British\nPM Mrs Margaret Thatcher was the first Western leader to visit Pakistan during the start of\nthe Afghan War. Britain gave a huge aid of 30 million pounds to Pakistan for the welfare of\nthe Afghan refugees. Soon another 16 million pounds were given for the refugees. By 1986,\nthe amount of bilateral trade with. Britain was around 376 million pounds. The only failure\nwas that Pakistan remained outside the Commonwealth during Zia’s rule.\nRelations with India were less successful. In the early 1980s, the Khalistan issue and\nthe Siachin glacier conflict adversely affected the relations. The Sikh separatists wanted an\n\n\nindependent state, Khalistan and India accused Pakistan of supporting the Indian Sikhs. The\nIndian PM Mrs Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguard in October 1984. Mr\nRajiv Gandhi, her son and the new PM, again accused Pakistan’s involvement in it though\nZia had declared a day of national mourning.\nZia was received in a cold way when he attended the cremation ceremony of Mrs Indira\nGandhi. By 1987, the Indian army began military exercises in the Rajasthan desert to\nintimidate Pakistan. Zia, however, paid a surprise visit to India on the pretext of watching a\ncricket ODI between the two countries. During his visit, he successfully persuaded the Indian\nleadership to withdraw its army. The exercises were halted, and this political move of Zia is\ncalled the Cricket Diplomacy.\nPakistan’s relations with the Muslim states generally remained successful. Pakistan\ntried to end the Iran-Iraq war through the OIC summit meetings but without any success.\nPakistan’s relations with Iran were mainly unsuccessful due to sectarian violence in Pakistan.\nPakistan extended humanitarian aid to Bangladesh after severe weather calamities in 1985\nand 1988. Relations with Afghanistan were also not successful as Pakistan had been helping\nthe Mujahideen against the communist Afghan government that had invited the Soviets.\nAfghan war planes bombed many areas of KPK in retaliation.\nIt seems Zia was quite successful in his foreign policy because during his rule the world\ngot rid of the Cold War, and heavy foreign aid helped Pakistan to start many development\nprojects to improve economic growth.\nSample Question for Q1\nSource A,\nText of the referendum on 19th December 1984, seeking a validation\nof Zia’s stay in power:\n“Whether the people of Pakistan endorse the process initiated by General Zia, the\nPresident of Pakistan, to bring the laws of Pakistan in conformity with the injunctions\nof Islam as laid down in the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet and for\nthe preservation of ideology of Pakistan, for the continuation and consolidation of that\nprocess for the smooth transfer of power to the elected representatives.”\nQ (a) According to source A, how is Zia trying to find ways to become\nan elected President?

Finally, the Pucca Qila massacre of Hyderabad in May\n1990 led to the killing of several MQM workers including women and children. This\nwas followed by 300 more deaths in Karachi and other cities. This proved to be the\nlast nail in the coffin of her government as President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed\nher government on 6th August, 1990 using his constitutional powers under the Article\n58-2(b) on the charges of corruption and mismanagement.",

          "question": "Why was Benazir Bhutto removed in 1996? (7)",
          "answer": "As Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto did not enjoy comfortable times. She was opposed\non all sides and by almost all provinces. She developed differences with her mother\nand brother. She cleverly pushed her mother, Begum Nusrat Bhutto, aside so that\nshe was no more active in politics. Later the murder of her brother, Murtaza in a police\noperation in Karachi raised many questions about her legitimacy as PM. She locked\nher horns with the Supreme Court by refuting the Court’s orders to dismiss 20 judges\nappointed by the government in the infamous “Judges Case” of 1996\nEconomic performance of her government was also not impressive. Pakistan\nborrowed heavily from the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and this led to strict\nfinancial controls and inflation that were blamed on the government. She desperately\ntried to improve economic performance of Pakistan but could not gain success mainly\ndue to growing corruption and her policy of favouritism. Her husband, Asif Zardari,\nhad become more notorious because of his alleged involvement in corruption and\npolitical kickbacks. He was sarcastically called Mr. 10% as he is reported to have\nasked for a share of 10% in exchange for approving the project of any person or\ncompany.\nVery strong opposition came from Punjab where the most powerful politician Mr.\nNawaz Sharif launched an aggressive campaign against her. He leveled charges of\ncorruption, mismanagement, inefficiency and flawed methods in handling various\naffairs. He organized rallies and demonstrations in several cities. Benazir’s husband,\nMr. Zardari proved to be her Achilles’ heel as she faced charges of involvement in\nvarious corruption cases, political kickbacks and paybacks. This greatly weakened\nher position and damaged her image. . Then the dismissal her Chief Minister, Manzur\nWattoo came as a great setback for her government as she was sharply criticized for\nmishandling the matter and losing more popularity in the largest province of Pakistan.\n\n\nSo, President Farooq Leghari using his powers under the article 58-2(b), dismissed\nher government on 5 November, 1996.",

          "question": "How successful was Benazir Bhutto in ruling Pakistan during\n1988-1990 and 1993-1996? (14)",
          "answer": "Benazir Bhutto was elected as the first woman Prime Minister of Pakistan in 1988 and\nserved in office till 1990. She had a mix of successes and failures. She highlighted\nher image as the first woman PM of the Muslim World both before the people of\nPakistan and the West. She ended a ban on the making of trade unions and students’\nunions in order win the confidence of industrial workers and students. Also many\npolitical prisoners of PPP were released that had been arrested by the Zia’s regime.\nMoreover, she declared a general pardon for many other political prisoners. She also\ninitiated the rural electrification programme. She took some steps exclusively for the\nwelfare of women. First Women’s Bank was opened in 1989. She recruited women in\npolice and civil services under a special scheme and appointed for the first time\nwomen judges of the High Courts. She tried to make Pakistan a democratic Islamic\nrepublic while abandoning the strict Islamic policies of Zia but this was hard to\nachieve. She couldn’t make any legislation in this regard because the opposition\ndominated the Senate and the largest province Punjab was under her rival Mr. Nawaz\nSharif. He was able to table a no confidence motion against Benazir by the end of\n1989 in the National Assembly. Though the motion was defeated by just twelve votes,\nit was a serious blow to her government. Therefore, no new laws were made to\nimprove the status of women despite all her claims mainly because the Hudood\nOrdinance could not be repealed. She gradually lost support as her government could\nnot fulfill the promises of reducing unemployment, making economic progress and\ncontrolling inflation and a high population growth. The drug abuse problem also\nworsened mainly due to the presence of several Afghan refugees in Pakistan.\nBenazir faced serious opposition by her party in Sindh. She made a coalition with the\nMQM, a party of Urdu speaking migrants from India but the PPP stalwarts in Sindh\nopposed her. The MQM wanted due rights at par with the Sindhi speaking population\nbut this led to growing conflict between MQM and PPP. Violence erupted in Karachi\nand other cities between September 1988 and May 1990 when the Pucca Qila\noperation against the MQM in Hyderabad became a reason of dismissal of her\ngovernment.\nIn foreign affairs, she made some achievements. Pakistan rejoined the\nCommonwealth in October 1989 as Pakistan had been recognized as a country with\na democratically elected government. She paid a successful visit to the USA in June\n1989 and the Bush administration promised an aid of over $400 million. In December\n1988, the Indian PM, Mr. Rajiv Gandhi visited Pakistan. It was a big success because\nfor the first time an Indian Prime Minister had visited Pakistan. Both countries signed\ntwo agreements in 1989 to promote mutual peace and cooperation. A hotline\ntelephone link was set up between the two countries to be used in times of crisis. The\nSAARC platform was also used to promote mutual ties. However, the massive\nKashmiri uprising since 1989 damaged the efforts of the two PM’s.\nBenazir returned to power in 1993 and formed a coalition govt. with some independent\nparties. MQM had boycotted the elections and performance of PPP was better in all\nprovinces. With her efforts Farooq Leghari of PPP was elected as the new President.\nOnce again she tried to improve the socio-economic status of women. She planned\nto establish women’s police stations, courts and banks but failed to make any\nlegislation in this regard. So her ‘Agenda of Change’ did not work.\n\n\nNawaz Sharif launched an aggressive campaign against her. He started that train\nmarch from Karachi to Peshawar while attracting huge crowds. Benazir arrested\nseveral opposition leaders but in vain. She also faced many family feuds regarding\nher mother Nusrat Bhutto and brother Murtaza Bhutto. Though she sidelined her\nmother, mysterious killing of Murtaza Bhutto by police in 1996 greatly damaged her\nrepute. Her husband Mr. Zardari also earned a bad repute for his wife as he was\ninvolved in many corruption cases and misuse of money. She failed to privatize the\nUBL (United Bank Limited) by selling it to a Saudi-based company. The attempt was\nhalted due to serious doubts about the transitions. In 1995, she took a heavy loan\nfrom the IMF but the economic situation worsened. Due to the Kashmir issue military\nspending increased by 14% in 1995-96. The result was inflation, unemployment,\nunrest and violence.\nShe had a confrontation with the Supreme Court by refusing to dismiss 20\njudges appointed by the government. Her dismissal of the Punjab CM, Mr. Wattoo\nalso added to her difficulties. Wattoo began to exploit her weak position and start\nworking more independently ignoring the PPP and its allies. This made matters worse\nfor her government as she had opposite expectations from the Chief Minister of the\nlargest province of Pakistan.\nIt may be concluded that Benazir was not very successful serving twice as PM\nmainly because she failed to have a two third majority in the parliament. This did not\nallow her to make new laws or annul some old laws. Also, fierce opposition by Mr.\nNawaz Sharif who had started gaining more popularity foiled many of her attempts to\nenjoy a stable government.",

          "question": "Was her confrontation with Nawaz Sharif the most important\nreason of Benazir’s removal from power in August 1990? Agree or\ndisagree? Explain.\n[14]",
          "answer": "Benazir Bhutto won a marginal majority in the 1988 elections. She was able\nto form a coalition government in the Centre, but failed to do so in the largest province,\nPunjab. Mr Sharif emerged as her most powerful rival from the platform of the IJI, a\ncoalition of the PML and various religious parties. She provoked her rival by\nappointing Mr Ghulam Mustafa Khar, a senior member of the PPP, as the governor\nof Punjab. The provincial government of Mr Sharif arrested three FIA (Federal\nInvestigation Agency) agents. They were sent by the central/ federal government to\ninvestigate the case of tax evasion by a factory, Riaz Bottlers, owned by a minister of\nthe Punjab.\nMr Sharif established the Bank of Punjab in 1989, but Ms Bhutto opposed it.\nShe termed it “treason against the federation “, though the 1973 constitution allowed\nsuch steps under the autonomy given to the provinces. He gradually organised a “No\nConfidence “motion in the National Assembly in October 1989. Opposition against Ms\nBhutto was so great that 107 members of the Assembly voted against her while 119\nwere needed to disqualify her as PM. Thus her government survived by a shortage of\nonly 12 votes.\nBenazir made an alliance with the MQM under the ‘Charter of Peace, Love\nand Rights’ in December 1988. Both parties were diametrically opposed to each other\nin the political views. Benazir had promised to protect the interest of the Sindhis and\nstamp out violence. However, she failed in her mission, and there was a large scale\nviolence in many cities of Sindh. On 30 September 1988, militant Sindhis opened fire\non a crowd in Hyderabad, causing 250 deaths, mostly Muhajirs/Urdu speaking people\n\n\nin Sindh. Later, there were more incidents of riots in Karachi. The most tragic event\nwas the Pucca Qila massacre of May 1989. Several workers of the MQM, alongwith\nwomen and children were killed in a shootout by police in a fort in Hyderabad.\nNewspapers reported that the women held copies of the Quran over their heads as\nthey cried out to the police stop shooting. Demonstrations and strikes were observed\nat several places in Hyderabad and Karachi. Finally, in August 1989, the MQM ended\nits alliance with the PPP and sided with Nawaz Sharif. This added to her troubles as\nher government in the Centre as well as Sindh got weaker\nBenazir Bhutto failed to have comfortable relations with President Ghulam\nIshaq Khan, and sometimes she openly clashed with him. A major area of\ndisagreement was over the key appointments in the military and the judiciary. Ishaq\nKhan considered that he had the right to make such appointments as the 8th\nconstitutional amendment had empowered him to nominate and dismiss the PM and\nthe assemblies. Both had disputes over many such appointments. She faced\naccusations of corruption, and her husband Mr Zardari was soon arrested on charges\nof corruption and blackmail. He was jailed for two years while Ms Bhutto defended\nhim by saying that such charges were politically motivated.\nHer government became unpopular as it failed to fulfill its promise of economic\ndevelopment and employment. Inflation and unemployment remained high with a high\npopulation growth rate. The government also failed in controlling the menace of drug\nabuse in Pakistan. Due to a lack of majority in the Parliament, Benazir’s government\ncould not make any legislation regarding the rights of women and changes in the\nIslamic laws introduced by General Zia-ul-Haq. Therefore, President Ghulam Ishaq\nKhan used his power to dismiss her government on 6th August 1990 on the charges\nof incompetence, corruption and misgovernance of the country.\nIt may be concluded that her rivalry with Mr Nawaz Sharif was the most\nimportant factor in her exit from power in 1990 because she failed to gain support\nfrom the largest province of Pakistan while losing popularity in major cities of Sindh,\ntoo.",

He skilfully mobilised masses in observing strikes in\n\n\nSeptember and October 1994. Benazir ordered arrest of several opponents\nbut it only increased her difficulties.\nBenazir was forced to increase defence expenses by 14% due to\ngrowing hostility with India over the Kashmir issue. 1994 to 1996, Indian and\nPakistani armies were on the verge of war, and Pakistan failed to defend its\ncase before the UN. Moreover, destructive floods and pest attacks on crops\ncaused a serious decline in agricultural output. All this caused a growing\neconomic crisis, and Benazir’s government had to seek aid from the IMF\n(International Monetary Fund) in 1995. In order to satisfy the IMF, new taxes\nwere levied on the people, and the rupee was devalued by 7%. This caused\ninflation, and people became more frustrated. The IMF, asked for more taxes\nand increased tariffs.\nIn 1996, in order to raise funds for economic development, Benazir tried\nto privatise the UBL (United Bank Ltd). Though very poor offers were made by\nvarious bidders, she allowed its sale to an apparently Saudi-based company.\nInvestigations proved that the buyers were actually some local businessmen\nclosely linked to the PPP. So, the sale of the bank was halted, and Benazir\nbecame more unpopular.\nA major problem faced by Benazir was her family feuds. Her mother,\nBegum Nusrat Bhutto wanted his son Mir Murtaza Bhutto to be the party\nchairperson which Benazir opposed. She removed her mother from a leading\nposition. Feeling disappointed, he founded Al-Zulfiqar Organization after his\nexile. He sharply criticised Benazir for betraying the principles of their father\nZ.A. Bhutto. He also targeted her husband, Mr Zardari who was involved in\nvarious corruption cases, and had earned the meaningful title of Mr 10%.\nMurtaza Bhutto was killed in a mysterious police encounter at a walking\ndistance from his residence in Clifton, Karachi. None of the policemen was\narrested, and instead, some were promoted. A judicial inquiry found the\ninvolvement of the government in this murder.\nBenazir also mismanaged the judiciary in the famous “judges case”. In\nMarch 1996, she refused to dismiss the 20 judges on the order of the Supreme\nCourt. Her attempts to intimidate the Chief Justice of Pakistan greatly\ndamaged her image. She also failed to curtail the authoritarian Chief Minister\nof the Punjab, Manzoor Watto. He was trying to exploit her weak position, and\nso, was removed from his post. This, too, brought more problems for Benazir’s\ngovernment.\nBenazir desperately accused some army officers with Islamic views\nwanted to destabilise her government.

Much to\nher surprise, President Leghari dismissed her government on 5th November\n1996 on the charges of misgovernance and corruption. Before this, army had\ntaken control of all key points in Islamabad, and had arrested Asif Zardari.\nIt seems the family feuds contributed the most to Benazir’s ouster from\npower because they weakened her abilities to concentrate on smooth running\nof government affairs.

          "answer": "Nawaz Sharif faced serious difficulties which eventually led to his dismissal from\npower. He attempted to solve Pakistan’s unemployment problem by providing cheap\nloans to men to buy taxis (Yellow Cab Scheme) that he had imported (Daewoo Cars).\nMost of the borrowers were unable to repay the loans and hence became defaulters\nand unemployed. This strained the economy and made him unpopular. Things\nbecame worse when he tried to finance major investment projects that depended\nupon foreign aid especially from the USA. This aid,$564 million was stopped under\nthe Pressler Amendment that was invoked due to the reduced importance of Pakistan\nin the post- Cold War era 1992 onwards. So, Pakistan faced more economic\ndifficulties.\nMoreover, the closure of a major bank, BCCI (Bank of Credit and Commerce\nand Investment) also added to Mr. Sharif’s difficulties. An inquiry by a British team of\naccountants detected large scale fraud and shady/questionabe lending practices of\nthe Bank. Along with this there was a decline in foreign remittances from the Middle\nEast due to the Gulf War. As a result of these policies Mr. Nawaz Sharif and his\ngovernment were blamed. The mismanagement of the Cooperative societies led to\nmillions of Pakistanis losing their life long savings. This money was lent to the Sharif\nfamily’s businesses. Though the loans were immediately repaid, Sharif’s image had\nbeen damaged. Violence in Pakistan that related to drugs and the use of guns led to\na strong response from Sharif but his actions were criticized by the opposition parties\nfor being too repressive. Finally, Sharif came into conflict with the President over the\nappointment of an army chief of staff and also with the Eighth Constitutional\nAmendment.

          "answer": "Nawaz Sharif was first elected in 1990 from the platform of the IJI (Islami Jamhuri\nIttehad). He gained fame for starting many new schemes but they were\novershadowed by various scandals. The BCCI (Bank of Credit and Commerce\n\n\nInternational) was the world’s 7th largest bank operating in Pakistan. It was founded\nby Mr. Agha Hasan Abedi in 1972. There were concerns about the bank’s lending\npractices and an investigation was conducted by a team of British accountants in\n1991. The team detected widespread fraud, embezzlement and manipulation in the\nbank. Following this, the bank was closed and was required to pay huge fines. Ittefaq\nIndustries of the Sharif family was its major customer. Despite its closure, the bank\nwas allowed to operate for several months in Pakistan, raising doubts about the links\nof the Sharif’s government with the bank.\nThe Cooperative Societies accepted deposits from members and extended loans only\nto members for purposes that were beneficial for the Society. Two of such societies\nwere controlled by the relatives of Mr. Sharif. In 1991, four societies in the Punjab\nsuddenly collapsed as a result of which more than two million people lost their life-\nlong savings. The failure of the National Industrial Cooperative Credit Company was\nthe biggest financial collapse in Pakistan. Mr. Sharif’s family had borrowed huge loans\nfrom these societies, and this increased unpopularity of his government.\nNawaz Sharif introduced the “yellow cab” scheme by giving loans to the unemployed\nyouth to buy taxis. This however was a failed scheme as most of the borrowers\nbecame defaulters as they were unable to repay the loans. He announced a national\nreconstruction program to industrialize Pakistan. His economic policies were\nundermined by a lack of capital for investment, especially after the stoppage of the\nUS aid of $ 564 million. Foreign capital increased when he loosened foreign exchange\nrestrictions and opened Pakistan’s stock market to foreign capital but the government\nstill faced a shortage of funds for investment. The US aid dropped significantly after\nthe Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1988. The reduction in overseas aid, high\nspendings by the government and a decrease in foreign remittances added to his\ndifficulties.\nSharif’s policy of supporting the Afghan warlords also created problems for him. This\nled to a culture of drug trafficking and use of illegal arms (the Klashinkov culture) as\na result of the Soviet-Afghan war. The government had to deal with rampant crime,\nterrorism and drug addiction especially in major cities like Karachi. The police and\nmilitary tried to maintain law and order but were unsuccessful. The government\npassed the 12th amendment to the constitution which provided “Speedy Trail Courts”\nto dispense summary justice. The aim of this was to control the crime rate but was\ncriticized by the Opposition as it suppressed fundamental human rights. Nawaz Sharif\npassed the Shariat Bill in May 1991, making the Quran and Sunnah the law of the\nland as long as it did not challenge the existing system of government. It was\nwelcomed by the religious parties but they wanted its immediate implementation. It\nbecame unpopular as the Opposition criticized the increased role of Islam in\ngovernment. Nawaz Sharif’s first term ended in 1993 when Ghulam Ishaq Khan\ndismissed his government on the allegations of corruption and mismanagement of the\neconomy.\nClosure of the BCCI seems to be the most important reason for the downfall of Nawaz\nSharif because the scandals involving misuse of money lowered his grace in the eyes\nof the whole nation.

He had started supporting\nthe Taliban and their government in Afghanistan. He refused to hand Usama bin Ladin\nover to US who suspected his involvement in the bombing of the US embassy in\nKenya. This damaged the Pak-US relations that were already strained since the end\nof the Cold War 1991-92.\nThe US was also critical of Pakistan’s nuclear ambitions. Its anger grew when\nPakistan tested nuclear weapons on 28th May 1998 in response to Indian doing the\nsame a couple of weeks ago. Pakistan’s economic and military aid was stopped by\nUS, Japan and West European states creating serious difficulties for Pakistan. Sharif\nhad to declare emergency in Pakistan and ordered freezing of the FCA’s (Foreign\nCurrency Accounts) of Pakistanis who had deposited their savings in foreign currency.\nThis made him unpopular.\nIn May 1999, the Pak Army was involved in a conflict with the Indian Army in Kargil,\nKashmir. After some initial gains it had to retreat and Sharif accused General Parvez\nMusharraf for this humiliation. The army rejected Sharif’s accusation. Sharif tried to\nreplace Musharraf with Gen.

He announced a national reconstruction program to industrialize Pakistan.\nHe introduced a policy of privatizing the SOU’s (State Owned Units) under which a\nnumber of important industries, such as shipping, electricity supply, airlines and\ntelecommunications were opened up to the private sector under the Privatization\nCommission. He introduced several large scale projects to simulate the economy,\nsuch as the Ghazi Barotha Hydro Power Project and the Gwadar Miniport in\nBalochistan. He introduced the “yellow cab” scheme by giving loans to the\nunemployed youth to buy taxis. This however was a failed scheme as most of the\nborrowers became defaulters as they were unable to repay the loans. Another major\nproject was to build the Motorway. The aim was to provide a fast transportation\nnetwork to the newly independent Central Asian Republics that needed access to\nseaports. Although its first phase, the M2 (between Islamabad and Lahore) was\ncompleted in Nov 1997, the project suffered from continual delays.\nNawaz Sharif’s economic policies were undermined by a lack of capital for\ninvestment, specially after the stoppage of the US aid of $ 564 million. Foreign capital\nincreased when he loosened foreign exchange restrictions and opened Pakistan’s\nstock market to foreign capital but the government still faced a shortage of funds for\ninvestment. The US aid dropped significantly after the Soviet withdrawal from\nAfghanistan in 1988. The reduction in overseas aid, high spendings by the\ngovernment and a decrease in foreign remittances added to his difficulties. The\nclosure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in 1991 was linked\nwith questionable lending practices and fraud, and blame was put on the government.\nSharif also lost popularity because of the ‘Co-operative Societies scandal’.\nCooperative societies accepted deposits from members and gave loans to them for\ninvestment schemes. However, mismanagement of these societies led to their\ncollapse in which millions of Pakistanis lost money. It was soon discovered that these\nsocieties had, granted large loans to Sharifs family business, the Ittefaq Group.\nAlthough Sharif hurriedly repaid the loans, his unpopularity increased.\nThere was also the problem of drug trafficking and illegal arms (the Klashinkov\nculture) as a result of the Soviet-Afghan war. The govt. had to deal with rampant\ncrime, terrorism and drug addiction especially in major cities like Karachi. The police\nand military tried to maintain law and order but were unsuccessful. The govt. passed\nthe 12th amendment to the constitution which provided “Speedy Trail Courts” to\ndispense summary justice. The aim of this was to control the crime rate but was\ncriticized by the Opposition as it suppressed fundamental human rights.

Nawaz Sharif’s first term ended in 1993 when Ghulam Ishaq Khan\ndismissed his government on the allegations of corruption and mismanagement of the\neconomy.\n\n\nNawaz Sharif was again elected as the Prime Minister in 1997. This time he had a\ndecisive majority in the parliament. So, his first acts was to pass the 13th Amendment\nwhich repealed the 8th Amendment that authorized the President to dismiss the Prime\nMinister and the assemblies. This measure was supported by all political parties. To\ncutail instability in the country. Sharif also passed the Anti-defection Bill under the 14th\namendment. This prevented politicians from switching parties (political turncoats) so\nthat they could not exploit any weak and vulnerable government. Using his powers\nfully, Sharif arrested journalists who wrote critical articles against him. Unexpected\ntax inspections of the selected newspaper editors were carried out.\nIn 1997, Sharif had to defend himself in the Supreme Court on charges of corruption.\nHe, using the Parliament’s support asked the President to dismiss the Chief Justice\nSajjad Ali Shah, and this led to a tussle between the government and the Supreme\nCourt. Sharif’s supporters stormed the building and proceedings had to be\nsuspended. In May 1998, Pakistan conducted nuclear explosions. This increased\nSharif’s popularity as people felt strengthened due to Pakistan becoming a nuclear\npower but it caused loss of foreign aid from the US, Japan and other countries putting\nPakistan in serious economic difficulties. The Sharif government had to freeze the\nFCA’s (Foreign Currency Accounts) of Pakistani depositors. Sharif had to raise the\nprice of fuel and negotiate bank loans to keep the government from bankruptcy. He\nalso introduced a state of emergency, curtailing all civil rights. Sharif tried to\nstrengthen his position by passing the 15th Amendment which made Sharia the\nsupreme law of Pakistan and empowered the PM to enforce the Sharia the full\nauthority. He did not ask the Senate to ratify the measure as he was uncertain about\nthe depth of his support. Sharif’s rule went into serious trouble during the Kargil crisis\nduring May 1999. He developed differences with General Pervez Musharraf over the\nwithdrawal of Pak Army from Kargil, Kashmir. Sharif tried to replace him with his\ncousin Gen. Butt, but found his govt. toppled by the army on 12th Oct. 1999.\nIt may be concluded that Nawaz Sharif was not very successful twice as PM because\nhe failed to have good relations with such important institutes as the armed forces\nand the supreme judiciary mainly because of his authoritarian way of governance and\npartly due to financial scams surrounding his government.",

          "answer": "Nawaz Sharif returned to power for the second time in February 1997. He had\na comfortable majority in the National Assembly and Senate. He, therefore,\nwas able to get important bills passed from the parliament. The 13th\namendment annulled the 8th amendment, and restored the powers of the PM,\nand made President just a ceremonial head of the state. The 14th amendment\nwas passed as the Anti-Defection Bill that restrained the parliamentarians to\nswitch loyalties in order to exploit a weak government. Apparently these were\ngood steps but the results were not good. Sharif’s government became\noppressive towards the opposition parties and the media. The Opposition felt\ninsecure in the parliament. Journalists who wrote against his government were\nthreatened or jailed. Heavy taxes were imposed on some newspapers. Sharif’s\n\n\nsecret police kidnapped a famous editor, Mr Najam Sethi, in May 1996, but\nhad to release him on international protests.\nThe same year Sharif locked horns with the Supreme Court. Sajjad Ali Shah\nhad been appointed as Chief Justice by Benazir Bhutto. He summoned Nawaz\nSharif to defend charges of corruption against him. Sharif wanted to reduce\nthe number of the Supreme Court judges from 17 to 12. Sajjad Ali asked the\nPresident to reinstate the 5 judges, Sharif got a motion passed from the\nNational Assembly asking the President to dismiss the Chief Justice.\nPresident Leghari, however, refused to obey Sharif’s unfair demand. In\nNovember 1997, hundreds of Sharif’s supporters attacked the Supreme Court\nbuilding during the proceedings of a “contempt of court case”. Sajjad Ali had\nto leave the court with other judges. In December 1997, both the President and\nthe Chief Justice resigned in protest. After some days, Rafiq Tarar, a retired\njudge, loyal to the Sharif family, became the new President, and Sajjad Ali\nShah was replaced by Justice Ajmal Mian as the permanent Chief Justice in a\nmysterious way. These developments affected Sharif’s popularity and\nopposition grew against him. In May 1998, Pakistan conducted nuclear blasts\nin response to the Indian nuclear testing the same month. Though it\nstrengthened Sharif’s political position, his government faced serious\neconomic challenges. Japan, the US and many other countries stopped aid to\nPakistan. Sharif declared emergency in the country, raised fuel prices and\nordered freezing of the FCAs (Foreign Currency Accounts) of all Pakistanis.\nArmy had been instrumental in Pakistani politics for a long time, and Sharif\nmade a desperate attempt to exclude army from political affairs. He removed\nthe army chief, General Jahangir Karamat when he demanded a position in\nthe National Security Council. Sharif appointed Pervez Musharraf as the next\nchief thinking he would cooperate with the government. Soon, however,\nMusharraf would prove more problematic than Sharif had imagined.\nOnly months after the Lahore Declaration of peace between India and\nPakistan, both countries were once again on the brink of a third war. The\nKashmiri guerrillas crossed the LoC (Line of Control) and occupied the\nstrategic Indian towns of Kargil and Drass in April 1999. India retaliated in May\n1999 and bombarded Pakistani territories heavily. Sharif initially denied, but\nsoon India provided evidence of Pakistani involvement in Kargil. After failing to\nseek the US intervention, Sharif ordered withdrawal of Pakistan army, and this\nbrought him in clash with Musharraf as both Sharif and army blamed each\nother for the failure in Kargil. People, in general, also opposed Sharif’s\ndecision. Sharif feared a coup, and decided to replace Musharraf with one of\nhis close relatives, General Zia ud Din Butt. While Musharraf was on a tour to\nSri Lanka, Sharif ordered the CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) not to let\nMusharraf’s plane land on any airport on his return. This unified top army\nofficials against Sharif, and on Musharraf’s safe landing, his government was\ntoppled on 12th October 1999. Musharraf declared military rule, not martial\nlaw, in Pakistan.\n\n\nIt may be said that Nawaz Sharif’s confrontation with General Musharraf was\nthe decisive factor in the loss of his government because, like Z.A. Bhutto, he\nalso miscalculated the power of the army as an organised and inherently stable\ninstitution of Pakistan.\nSource A: a statement by General Pervez Musharraf about the Kargil issue,\n“Pakistan was in a dominating position in five different fronts in the war.

          "question": "How successful was Pakistan in establishing a new constitution\nbetween 1947 and 1973? Explain you answer. (14)",
          "answer": "Making the constitution was a slow process. In March 1949, the Objectives Resolution\nwas passed by the National Assembly under Liaqat Ali Khan’s government. It\nproposed a plan of making the constitution based on the objectives of democracy,\nequality and social justice as laid down by Islam. It also guaranteed protection of\nhuman rights and religious minorities as well as an independent judiciary. In 1952,\ncertain Islamic clauses were included in the draft in order to satisfy the Ulema. The\nhead of state was required to be a Muslim. The government was to be guided by a\nteam of religious scholars to make laws according to Islam. Moreover, it\nrecommended a bicameral parliament with equal seats for East and West Pakistan.\nHowever, the Objectives Resolution was criticised especially by East Pakistan who\nresented that Urdu was to be the official language because Bengali was spoken by\nall the East Pakistanis. It also opposed the idea of equal representation in the National\nAssembly, and demanded seats according to the size of its population. The death, of\nLiaqat Ali Khan in 1951, caused an unusual delay in the process of constitution\nmaking. The Basic Principles Committee’s report also failed to resolve the issue of\nthe official language and the number of seats in the National Assembly.\nThe second Constituent Assembly, under Chaudhry Muhammad Ali, implemented the\nconstitution on 23rd March 1956. Under the constitution, name of the country was the\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan whose president was to be a Muslim of over 40. He was\nto be elected by the National and Provincial Assemblies and he had the power to\nappoint and dismiss the PM and dissolve the assemblies. The National Assembly had\nequal seats of East and West Pakistan. Urdu and Bengali were declared the national\nlanguages. The constitution was, however, heavily criticised since it empowered the\npresident to dismiss the elected government and dissolve the parliament. This went\nagainst the spirit of a parliamentary form of government. East Pakistan was very\nunhappy at not having majority in the Assembly that it believed its vast population\ndeserved.\nAyub Khan introduced the Basic Democracies in 1959 that comprised a four tier\nstructure of local governments elected at various levels. Due to the success of this\nsystem, a new constitution was enforced in March 1962 after lifting the martial law.\nThe constitution introduced a presidential form of government with the National\nAssembly having equal seats for East and West Pakistan. The president was elected\nby the Basic Democrats for five years. He could make any law or reject the legislation\nof the parliament. However, the constitution gradually became unpopular due to the\ndominance and powers of landlords in the parliament. The Basic Democracies often\nused force or bribery to influence the results. The constitution also upset the people\nof East Pakistan as they were once again under-represented in the Parliament that\nwas made a subordinate body to a military ruler.\nIn August 1973, Z.A. Bhutto enforced the 1973 Constitution that introduced a purely\nparliamentary form of government with a bicameral parliament. The upper house was\nthe Senate while the lower house was the National Assembly. The PM, elected by the\nNational Assembly for five years, was the executive head whereas the president was\nonly a figure head of the state. It introduced more Islamic clauses. However, the\nUlema launched an anti-Qadiani movement in 1974, and the government was forced\nto redefine a Muslim under a constitutional amendment.\nIt may be concluded that Pakistan was quite successful in making a new constitution\nbecause the process was completed after several setbacks, political instability and\ntwo military coups. The Pakistani politics evolved through all these hindrances to\nfinally achieve the goal of a purely parliamentary form of government in 1973. This\nconstitution managed to survive in the years to come.",

Pakistan was pressurized to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)\nin 1980 but Pakistan subjected its acceptance to India doing the same. Benazir Bhutto\ndefended Pakistan’s nuclear programme in her speech in the US Congress as she could not\nrick disturbed relations with the US. The US had started extending generous military aid to\nPakistan after the Soviet invasion on Afghanistan in December 1979. However, after 1985\nthis aid was stopped under the Presslar Amendment. Under this the US aid could be given\nto a country that the American President declared as a non-nuclear state. By pointing to\nPakistan’s nuclear ambitions, the promised economic aid of $ 4 million was stopped.\nThe stoppage of the aid adversely affected Pakistan as it had been supporting the US\nin its war against the Soviets through the Afghan Mujahideen. Pakistan had paid money to\nbuy 28 F-16 war planes from the US who suddenly refused to deliver the planes as well as\nreturn the paid money. Pakistan was the third largest recipient of the US aid, and the\npromised package was to run until 1993. This led to a significant deterioration of relations\nbetween the two countries, and many economic development projects of Pakistan were\nsuspended.\nIn the early 1990s, Pakistan’s importance for the US decreased after the Soviet\nwithdrawal from Afghanistan and the end of the Cold War. In 1992, the US was about the\ndeclare Pakistan as state sponsor of terrorism and place economic sanctions on it. Pakistan\n\n\nprotested on this by pointing towards India who too had been more ambitious of acquiring\nnuclear weapons. It also reminded the US of its support in the 1990 Gulf War but the US\ncontinued to condemn Pakistan’s nuclear ambition. Finally, when Pakistan conducted nuclear\nblasts in May 1998, after India had taken the initiative the same month. Pakistan, however,\nfaced more serious consequences. Many countries stopped economic and military aid to it\nincluding Japan, the US and the UK. This led to Pakistan facing economic difficulties, and the\nSharif government had to declare a financial emergency, take fresh loans and freeze the\nforeign currency accounts of several Pakistanis in the local banks.",

          "question": "How successful was Pakistan in its relationship with the USA\nbetween 1947 and 1999? (14)\nNote: For Q.2-5, part c, 14 marks; for Q.1 part d, 10 marks",
          "answer": "Pak-US relations have been generally successful. In 1947, at the time of creation of\nPakistan, the USA was engaged in the Cold War, a state of hostility between the USA\nand the USSR/now Russia. It was busy in the anti-Soviet alliances in various parts of\nthe world. It, therefore, took some years for the USA to recognize the geo-political\nimportance of Pakistan. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Liaqat Ali Khan changed his plan\nto visit Moscow, and flew to Washington in 1950. This laid the basis of the Pak-USA\nrelations.\nThroughout the 1950’s Pakistan received military and economic aid from the USA and\njoined the US-sponsored anti-Soviet/communist regional military blocs of the SEATO\n(South East Asian Treaty Organization) and the CENTO (Central Treaty Organization)\nto counter the Soviet in the South East Asia and the Middle East, in 1954 and 1955.\nUnder the Mutual Defence Assistance Agreement in May 1954 and some other\nagreements heavy aid was granted to Pakistan.\nIn the late 1950’s, Ayub Khan allowed the USA to build air bases in Pakistan to\nconduct espionage on the Soviets. After the 1965 Pak-India war, the US aid was\ngradually restored but the warmth of relations was visibly reduced. 1979 onwards,\nthere was remarkable improvement in relations after the Soviet attack on Afghanistan.\nPakistan assumed great importance for the USA who extended heavy military and\neconomic aid to Pakistan so that it could help the Afghan Mujahideen against the\nSoviets and accommodate millions of Afghan refugees. Zia’s government in 1981,\nreceived and aid of $1.6 billion and a further 1.5 billion Pound Sterling loan at low\ninterest rate to buy modern American weapons. In 1986, $4.2 billion military and\neconomic aid was given. Thus, after Israel and Egypt, Pakistan became the 3rd largest\nrecipient of American aid. After the end of the Afghan war, Benazir Bhutto visited the\nUSA in June 1989 to try to improve relations. Nawaz Sharif’s visits to Washington\n1991-1992, were attempts to convince the US about the peaceful nuclear program of\nPakistan. President Bill Clinton tried to restore relations by opposing the Pressler\nAmendment that had stopped aid to Pakistan. In January 1995 the Defence\nSecretary, William Perry visited Pakistan and promised aid. Benazir Bhutto visited the\nUSA in 1996 and, under the Brown Amendment, many sanctions were lifted and a\npackage of $388 million military aid was given to Pakistan. In 1996 Mrs. Hilary Clinton\nvisited Pakistan to further improve relations.\nHowever, there were many failures in the relations. 1947-1950 the US attitude was\ncold towards Pakistan. In the 1962 India-China war, American aid to India\ndisappointed Pakistan. Ayub’s visits to Beijing and Moscow in the 1960’s greatly\noffended the Americans. In the wars of 1965 and 1971, the US aid to Pakistan was\nstopped. Pakistan also could not receive any aid from the SEATO and CENTO\n\n\nbecause they could only help Pakistan in case of attack by a communist state (the\nUSSR).\n\n\nZ.A. Bhutto’s visible pro-Soviet and pro-China policies also damaged the Pak-USA\nrelations. Despite his visit to Washington in 1972, he could not get any aid. The US\nalso criticized Bhutto’s threat to develop nuclear weapons in 1974. Bhutto blamed the\nUSA for supporting the anti-Bhutto campaign of 1977. In Nov. 1979, during Zia’s\ngovernment, the US Embassy in Islamabad was burned by an angry mob. The US\naccused Zia of supporting the mob. Under the Geneva Accord of 1988, the USSR\nagreed to withdraw from Afghanistan. This suddenly reduced Pakistan’s importance\nfor the USA. Under various laws, the US aid was stopped and objections were raised\nabout Pakistan’s nuclear programs. Senator Larry Pressler in 1991 warned Pakistan\nto take steps against the growth of fundamentalism (extremism in Muslims). In 1996,\nthe US objected to China’s plan to supply M-11 missiles to Pakistan. In the late 1990’s,\nthe issue of Taliban and Nawaz Sharif’s refusal to hand over Usama bin Laden to the\nUSA damaged the relations. In May 1998, Pakistan’s nuclear blasts shocked the USA\nand all aid was stopped to Pakistan.\nIt may be concluded that the relations were generally successful because of\nPakistan’s strategic location in South Asia and its keenness to promote the American\ninterests in the region for the sake of maintaining a balance of power by countering\nthe Indian dream of becoming the policeman in the region.\nPakistan-USSR/Soviet Union Relations\nThe USSR till 1990; Russia/The Russian Federation/Russia 1990\nonwards",

          "answer": "Pakistan maintained good relations with Great Britain and the Commonwealth. After\nindependence in 1947, the British provided Jinnah with help at the top levels of both\nthe military and the civil service. There were many senior British officers like General\nDouglas Gracy in the Pakistan army to train them along modern lines. It also gave\nfinancial and technical aid and advice to cope with the difficulties. Pakistan chose to\nremain a member of the Commonwealth as it was now a British dominion (being\nindependent but recognizing the British Emperor as technical head of state). In a\nCommonwealth meeting in 1950 in Colombo, the Colombo Plan was set up to extend\naid to Pakistan. It also provided one million Sterling Pounds for the Sui gas project.\nCanada gave $ 40 million for the development of railways.\nIn 1954-55 Pakistan and Britain agreed to work together as members of SEATO and\nCENTO. Britain played key role in ending the 1965 war. Then during the Afghanistan\ncrisis, Britain supported Pakistan. British PM Mrs. Margaret Thatcher was the first\nWestern leader to visit Pakistan in 1981 during the Afghan war. An aid of 30 million\nSterling Pounds was given to Pakistan to accommodate the Afghan refugees. Another\naid of 16 million Sterling Pounds was given to help refugees in Balochistan and KPK.\nDuring the 1980’s Britain remained a major trading partner of Pakistan, with an\nestimated 376 million Sterling Pounds worth a trade between the two countries by\n1986. Benazir Bhutto rejoined the Commonwealth in 1989 as the military rule of Zia\nhad ended in 1988. In the 1990’s both Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif continued to\npay visits to Great Britain to strengthen mutual relations. Pakistan has been an active\nparticipant in the Commonwealth Games. The Queen of England visited Pakistan on\n14th August 1997 to attend the Golden Jubilee ceremony of the creation of Pakistan.\nShe was accorded very warm welcome. Presence of a sizeable Pakistani population\nin England has also played an important role in improving the relations. Some of these\nPakistanis managed to get elected in the British Parliament.\nHowever, relations between the two states have witnessed failures too. Many\nPakistani army officers were not happy with the British officers in their ranks and some\nof them unsuccessfully tried a military coup in 1951. Pakistani government also had\nreservations about the Radcliffe Award as some Muslim majority districts in Punjab\nhad been given to India. British failure to resolve the Kashmir dispute was also a\nsetback for the relations. In 1956, the British attack on the Suez Canal in Egypt was\ncriticized by Pakistan. Relations were also affected when Pakistan could not receive\nany aid from SEATO and CENTO in the wars of 1965 and 1971. When Great Britain\nrecognized the Republic of Bangladesh, Pakistan left SEATO and the\nCommonwealth.\nZ.A. Bhutto’s inclination towards the communist and socialist states of the USSR and\nChina was not liked by Great Britain. When death sentence was awarded to Bhutto,\nBritain did not pressurize Zia for an amnesty to Bhutto though Bhutto expected this\nfrom his friend Mr. James Callaghan, the British Foreign Minister. In the 1990’s, Great\nBritain, like the USA continued to express its concerns over Pakistan’s nuclear\nprogram. When Pakistan conducted nuclear blasts in May 1998, Britain and the\nCommonwealth stopped aid to Pakistan.\nLooking objectively, it may be concluded that Pakistan’s relations with Great Britain\nand the Commonwealth have been quite successful because of good trade relations\nand British interest in investing in various development projects of Pakistan.\nPakistan-China Relations",

          "answer": "Pakistan-China relations have been quite successful. Pakistan recognized the post-\nrevolution communist regime under Mao Zedong in January 1950. It supported\nChina’s membership of the UN in 1952. In the 1950’s there was no major\nbreakthrough in relations but in March 1962, Pakistan and china began to settle the\nborder dispute on the GB-Tibet border. China made many concessions in the border\ndispute in order to win Pakistan’s support to counter declining relations with India and\nthe USSR. The issue was fully settled by March 1963. The 1962 Sino-India/China-\nIndia war came as a blessing in disguise for Pakistan. China began to extend heavy\naid to Pakistan. In 1963, a series of trade agreements were signed and a $60 million\ninterest free loan was given to Pakistan. China soon became the largest importer of\nraw cotton from Pakistan and promised to help Pakistan in any war with India. In\nAugust 1963 the PIA (Pakistan International Airlines) began regular flights to China in\norder to improve cultural and trade relations.\nIn 1964 China declared its support for Pakistan on the Kashmir issue and in return,\nPakistan supported China’s entry to the UN Security Council much to the displeasure\nof the USA who was supporting Taiwan (non-communist breakaway from China) as\nthe legitimate ruler of China. During the 1965 Pak-India war, China applied diplomatic\npressure on India and extended moral and military aid to Pakistan including the T-59\ntanks.\nThough unable to help Pakistan in the 1971 war, China resumed support for Pakistan.\nIn February 1972, Z.A.Bhutto visited China and sought heavy military and economic\naid. Pakistan built the HMC (Heavy Mechanical Complex) in Taxila with the Chinese\nassistance. During Zia’s regime the old Silk Route was remodeled as the KKH\n(Karakoram Highway) in 1978. Then in 1986 Zia visited China and signed a nuclear\nco-operation treaty with the Chinese government.\nPakistan offered help to China in the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. In\nNovember 1989, Chinese PM Peng’s visit to Pakistan further strengthened the\nrelations. During the first tenure of Nawaz Sharif as PM of Pakistan, he visited China\nin February, 1991 and in the October 1991 Chinese President Mr. Shangkun visited\nPakistan.\nIn the 1990’s China provided technical and material support for the completion of the\n300 MW Chashma Nuclear Power Complex and the plutonium reprocessing facility.\nBoth Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif paid successful visits to China and convinced\nChina to invest in the Gawadar development project and other similar schemes.\n\n\nHowever, there were some failures too. Throughout the 1950’s there was no progress\nin improving relations. Pakistan was busy in solving its own problems and, therefore,\ncould not realize the importance of such a major neighbouring country. There was a\ncontinuous delay in initiating the talks for the border dispute and that increased\nPakistan’s concerns. In 1959 Pakistan voted against China’s membership of the UNO\nand condemned the military action in Tibet, though China did not react angrily.\nChina could not help Pakistan in the 1971 war because of the Agreement of Peace,\nCo-operation and Friendship between India and the USSR. This agreement contained\na threat to a country helping any state against India in a war.\nIn the 1990’s, the Cold War had ended and the USSR had broken up into independent\nstates. In this changing scenario China tried to improve relations with India and other\nstates. However, there was little progress in India-China relations.\nIt may finally be concluded that Pak-China relations have been very successful\nbecause of the growing common interests of the two countries. China’s long-term\nplans to invest in various development schemes in Pakistan are the key factor in\nmaintaining friendly relations.\nPakistan-India Relations",

          "answer": "India was instrumental in the creation of Bangladesh. It had trained and equipped the\nmilitant Mukti Bahini against Pakistan. After the 1971 war, more than 90,000 Pakistani\ntroops were taken as captives by India. Z.A. Bhutto signed the Simla agreement with\nMrs. Indira Gandhi in 1972. She agreed to release the captives on the condition of\nnegotiating the Kashmir issue bilaterally, without involving a third party like the UNO.\nThis angered Pakistan that wanted the UN intervention in the Kashmir issue.\nIndia conducted its nuclear experiment in Rajasthan in 1974. Pakistan was shocked\nas this act of India had threatened the peace and strategic balance in the South Asian\nregion. It raised real fears about its security after its neighbour had acquired a nuclear\ncapability. Bhutto retaliated by delivering an impassioned speech in which he declared\nthat the people of Pakistan would develop nuclear capacity even though they had to\neat grass.\nIn the 1980s, Indian presence in the Siachen Glacier region and the Khalistan issue\nalso disturbed the relations between the two states. Both wanted to capture the\nSiachen Glacier but were unsuccessful. India accused Pakistan of supporting the\nmilitant Sikhs who wanted Eastern Punjab to be an independent state, the\nKhalistan.

          "answer": "Pakistan has not been very successful in its relations with India as there have been\nfewer successes and several failures. In 1948, Indian Pakistan successfully drew a\nborder between the East Pakistan and Assam. The same year, both countries agreed\non a ceasefire on the influence of the UN after the first war on Kashmir. A temporary\nborderline, the LOC (Line of Control) was accepted by both countries. In 1950 the\nMinorities Agreement/the Liaqat-Nehru Pact was signed in which both countries\nagreed to stop the movement of minorities across the border and encourage them to\nstay back in their homelands. In the 1950’s, Jawahar Lal Nehru promised to hold a\nplebiscite in the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir in order to resolve this conflict\nbetween the two states.\nIn September 1960, the Indus Water Treaty was signed to resolve the issue of the\ncanal waters that had originated with the partition of the Punjab in 1947. Both\ncountries accepted the mediatory role of the USSR for a peace agreement after the\n1965 war. Accordingly, the Tashkent Accord was signed in the Soviet city of Tashkent.\nZ.A. Bhutto visited New Delhi and persuaded the Indian PM Mrs. Indra Gandhi to\nstrike a peace deal about the release of more than 90,000 POWs (Prisoners of War)\nthat had been in the Indian custody after the fall of East Pakistan on 16 December\n1971. Both PM’s signed the Simla Agreement in July 1972 and agreed to resolve all\nbilateral issues without involving a third party (the UNO etc.). All the Pakistani POWs\nwere released gradually.\nIn 1984, Gen. Zia visited India to attend the funeral ceremony of the Indian PM Mrs.\nIndira Gandhi who had been shot dead by her Sikh bodyguard. After the formation of\nthe SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) both countries got a\ncommon platform to work for the promotion of peace. In the late 1980’s, Gen. Zia was\nable to defuse hostility between the two states by using his “Cricket Diplomacy”. Both\ncountries had to major conflicts in those years: the Siachen Glacier and the Khalistan\nissues. Zia would pay a surprise visit to India on the pretext of watching a Pak-India\nODI (One Day International) cricket match between the two teams. He would thus\npersuade the Indian PM Mr. Rajiv Gandhi to hold peace talks. This way Zia was able\nto prevent a fourth Indo-Pak war.\nBenazir Bhutto was enthusiastic in improving relations with India. She used the\nplatform of the SAARC and the Commonwealth for this. Pakistan rejoined the\nCommonwealth in 1989 after India had stopped opposing Pakistan’s re-entry on the\nground of military rule in Pakistan. Rajiv Gandhi and Benazir Bhutto exchanged visits\nto Islamabad and Delhi and pledged to promote peace between the two most\nimportant South Asian countries. Both also organized the SAF (South Asian\nFederation) games and the SAARC cultural exchange programs. Similarly, Nawaz\nSharif also continued the efforts of promoting peace and reducing hostility. The\nLahore Accord was signed between Mr. Sharif and the Indian PM Mr. Vajpayee in\n1998 and a bus service was started between Pakistan and India.\n\n\nHowever, several setbacks thwarted the attempts of having peaceful relations with\nIndia. The Indian government had not acknowledged the creation of Pakistan and\ncreated serious difficulties for the newly created state. Millions of Muslims were forced\nto migrate to Pakistan. India delayed the release of financial and military assets to\nPakistan and closed the two headworks in Indian Punjab to create serious shortage\nof water for Pakistan. The issue persisted throughout the 1950’s.\nBoth countries had their first war on Kashmir in 1948 as a result of which the state of\nKashmir was divided into the IHK (Indian Held Kashmir) and the Azad Kashmir. India\nnever fulfilled the promise of holding a plebiscite/referendum in the disputed state of\nKashmir and that aggravated hostility between the two countries. The second war on\nKashmir was fought in September 1965 in which neither country was successful. Ayub\nhad expected a massive Kashmiri uprising but it did not happen. The Indians had\nplanned to occupy Lahore but that dream too was shattered.\nThe third Indo-Pak war was fought in December 1971 in the East Pakistan. The Indian\narmy had been training and equipping the militant Bengali separatists, the Mukti\nBahini (the liberation force) and therefore, the Pakistan army failed to get the local\nsupport and lost the War. More than 90,000 Pakistani officers and soldiers became\nIndian captives. Only two years after the signing of the Simla Accord, India conducted\nits nuclear experimentation in the Rajasthan desert in 1974. The Pakistani PM Mr.\nZ.A.Bhutto threatened to retaliate, and the relations began to deteriorate.\nIn the 1980’s, Pakistan detected the presence of the Indian army on the Siachin\nGlacier and this led to a series of small skirmishes though the war was never declared.\nSimilarly, in the early 1980’s the Indian Sikhs started the Khalistan Movement\ndemanding the separation of the Indian Punjab as an independent state. The Indian\narmy was used to suppress the movement and the Zia’s government was accused of\nsupporting and training the Sikhs. When Mrs. Indra Gandhi was assassinated by her\nSikh bodyguard, her son Rajiv Gandhi blamed Pakistan for this, and he received Gen.\nZia without any warmth on his visit to India for attending the funeral rites of Indira\nGandhi.\nA large scale uprising by the Kashmiri Muslims in 1989 once again worsened the Pak-\nIndia relations. The uprising got stronger throughout the 1990’s. In May 1998, both\ncountries blasted nuclear bombs and declared themselves as the nuclear states. This\ntook the disturbed relations to their peak. Then in April 1999 the Kashmiri Muslim\nguerrillas crossed the LOC and occupied the towns of Kargil and Drass in the IHK.\nPakistan initially showed ignorance about the development but soon it mobilized its\narmy in the region. The Indian army launched a counter attack and finally, in June\n1999 Pakistani forces began to withdraw on the pressure of the USA.\nAnalyzing in an unbiased way, it may be concluded that the Pak-India relations have\nbeen a failure mainly because of the lack of sincerity shown by various governments\nand the Indian dream of becoming the policeman of the South Asian region. India\nnever accepted the creation of Pakistan and has been delaying the resolution of the\nKashmir issue since 1947.\nPakistan-Afghanistan Relations",

This laid the foundation\nof friendly relations. Both countries joined the Baghdad Pact together with the UK.\nThey retained their membership of the Pact after Iraq left it in 1959 and it became\nknown as CENTO. In July 1964, largely as a result of the efforts of Ayub Khan, the\nRCD (Regional Cooperation for Development) was founded that comprised Pakistan,\nIran and Turkey as its members. The RCD provided a platform to its members develop\ncloser trade links and help each other in industrial projects and strengthening the\ncultural relations. The RCD Highway and the RCD Railway track were developed to\nfacilitate journey between the three states.\nIran and Turkey tried to persuade other countries to help Pakistan in the 1965 war,\nbut had little success. Iran sent help to the Bhutto’s government in 1973 to put down\nan uprising by the tribal chiefs in Balochistan. In the 1980’s, General Zia tried to\nminimize the mistrust between Pakistan and Iran. Pakistan made sincere efforts to\nend the Iran-Iraq war through the platform of the OIC. Similarly, Benazir Bhutto and\nNawaz Sharif also tried to improve relations with Iran. Pakistan’s relations with Turkey\ntraditionally remained friendly. In 1999, a free trade agreement was signed between\nthe two countries. Pakistan has been a major importer of oil from Iran.\nThe Islamic Revolution of Iran in 1979, brought Ayat Ullah Khomeini as the Iranian\nhead of state and the Shah of Iran had to go into exile. The Sunni views of General\nZia ul Haq were in a visible clash with the staunch Shia views of Khomeini. As a result\nthe relations were adversely affected and the RCD gradually became insignificant. It\nwas revived as the ECO (Economic Cooperation Organization) but the rapidly\n\n\nchanging regional and global scenario kept it quite ineffective. Then, the sectarian\nviolence in Pakistan, mainly in the form of the Shia-Sunni clashes in the 1980’s\ncaused further deteriorations of relations. The anti-American Khomeini strongly\nobjected to Pakistan receiving heavy US aid during the Afghan war.\nIn the 1990’s, both countries had sharp differences over the issue of the post-war\nAfghanistan. Iran did not like Pakistan’s support for the extremist Taliban government\nof Afghanistan. It objected to Pakistan’s continuous involvement in the Afghan affairs.\nThe sectarian violence in Pakistan also contributed to a state of disturbed relations\nbetween Pakistan and Iran.\nIt may be concluded that the relations between Pakistan and Iran have been\nsuccessful because of a common cultural and historic background as well as a\ncommon geographical border.

In June 1974 Bhutto visited Bangladesh and paid homage to Bangladesh’s war\nmemorial at Savar Upazila. He tried to reach an agreement with Sheikh Mujeeb in\n1975 for the division of assets. Mujeeb asked Bhutto to agree to give Bangladesh\nover half of Pakistan’s pre-1971 external reserves but Bhutto rejected this demand.\nMujeeb also inisisted that Pakistan take all non-Bengalis left scattered in Bangladesh\nafter the 1971 war. They were the Muslims who had migrated from India in 1947,\nmainly from the neighbouring Indian province of Bihar. Bhutto also rejected it as\nunreasonable. In 1975-76 both countries appointed ambassadors, and signed an\nagreement to cooperate on trade, tourism and the media.\nRelations began to improve in the 1980’s under the governments of Zia ur Rahman\nand Hussain Muhammad Irshad in Bangladesh. General Zia ul Haq paid visits to\nBangladesh and signed a number of agreements to promote trade and culture\nbetween the two states. In his visit to Bangladesh in 1985 and founded SAARC (South\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation) with the help of his Bangladeshi\ncounterpart General Zia ur Rahman. He also visited the war memorial and said, “Your\nheroes are our heroes.” By 1986, trade between the two countries had reached a\nvalue of $40 million. In 1985 and 1988 Pakistan was the first country to have sent aid\nto Bangladesh after it was hit by worst kind of floods.\nWhen Benazir Bhutto came to power in 1988, she too used the SAARC platform to\npromote friendly relations with Bangladesh. Many SAARC cultural exchange\nprograms were organized alongwith the SAF (South Asian Federation) Games.\nSimilarly, Nawaz Sharif also held meetings with the Bangladeshi Prime Ministers in\nthe SAARC conferences. The Chief Minister of Punjab, Ghulam Hyder Wayen,\naccommodated some of the non-Bengali/Bihari refugees in Pakistan. In 1998, PM\nSheikh Hasina Wajid paid a goodwill visit to Pakistan.\nAs for failures, relations remained strained in the beginning as Pakistan considered\nBangladesh a traitor who had sought the Indian aid for its liberation. So, it was\nreluctant to recognize Bangladesh. For the same reason, Pakistan left the\nCommonwealth and SEATO when Great Britain recognized it. Pakistan also refused\nto accommodate the pro-Pakistan non-Bengali, mainly Biharis who had migrated from\nIndia after independence, they were shifted to special camps by the Bangladeshi\ngovernment and forced to live a sub-human life in these camps. Both countries failed\nto reach a mutually acceptable agreement for the reallocation of the assets left in the\ntwo countries. Various governments of Pakistan have also refused to extend an\napology for what the Bangladeshi government declares as war crimes. Pakistan army\nwas accused of committing excesses against the Bengali population and Bangladesh\nhas been asking Pakistan to apologize for it.\nOn the whole, relations have been successful because with the passage of time the\nwounds inflicted on the Bengali people during the 1971 war have started healing. The\nplatforms like the Commonwealth and the SAARC have also played their role to bring\nthe two countries closer to each other.",

          "question": "Why did Pakistan support the Palestinian cause between 1947 and\n1999? (7)",
          "answer": "Pakistan had brotherly feelings for the Palestinian Muslims. In 1948, the\nQuaid-i-Azam warned the USA of the consequences of partition of Palestine and the\ncreation of Israel. However, the state of Israel was created by displacing a huge\nnumber of Palestinian Muslims, and this laid the foundation of Palestine-Israel conflict.\nSince then both the Pakistani people and governments have strongly supported the\nPalestine cause. Pakistan always condemned illegal occupation of other states\nthroughout the world in line with the UN objective of promoting international peace.\nIn1967, an extremist Israeli tried to burn the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\nFollowing this, the Muslim countries held a summit conference in Rabat, Morocco, in\n1969. On Pakistan’s suggestion the OIC (Organization of Islamic Conference) was\nset up, and its objective was to protect the rights of the Muslim world, and especially\nthe Palestininan Muslims. Pakistan, being an active member of the OIC, considered\nthe Israeli occupation of Palestine as totally unjustified. It wanted the Palestinian\nMuslims to live in an independent state without any fear of aggression by the other\nstates.\nAfter the Arab-Israel war in October 1973, Pakistan’s PM Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto\nconvened the second summit of the OIC in Ferburary 1974 in Lahore. Yasser Arafat,\nhead of the PLO (Palestinian Liberation Organization) attended it along with the other\n35 heads of the Muslim states. They reaffirmed their opposition to Israel’s occupation\nof Palestinian lands, and tried to draw the attention of the world powers towards a\npeaceful settlement of this conflict. The summit demonstrated the unity of the Muslim\nworld for a common cause, and importance of Pakistan as a strong supporter of the\nPalestine cause.\nPakistan as the Member of World Organizations",

          "question": "Why did Pakistan joined the UNO in 1947? (7)",
          "answer": "Pakistan needed to be recognised as an important country. It was a newly\ncreated country and needed recognition as a member seeking international peace.\nOn September 30, 1947, it joined the UNO to achieve the objective. Many countries\nwere struggling for independence during the early years of the Cold War (1945-1990)\nand Pakistan took upon itself to be the spokesman of these countries. For example,\nit spoke up against the occupation of Indonesia by Holland, and supported the\nfreedom movement of Morocco and Algiers. It also took the Palestinian issue to the\nUN while condemning the illegal occupation of Palestine by Israel.\nIndia had created many difficulties for Pakistan soon after independence. It\nhad taken the Kashmir issue to the UN, in 1947, and persuaded India and Pakistan\nfor a ceasefire after the 1948 war. Pakistan wanted the UN to play its due role in a\npermanent settlement of the Kashmir issue.\nIn order to deal with its economic difficulties, Pakistan needed the help of such\ninternational monetary bodies as the World Bank because India had been delaying\nthe release of Pakistan’s share of economic assets. Pakistan’s membership of the\nUNO became important when it began to mediate for resolving the canal water\ndispute. With the help of the World Bank, the issue was finally resolved in 1960 by the\nsigning of the Indus Water Treaty.",

          "answer": "Pakistan played active role as a member of many world organizations. It joined the\nUNO in September 1947 to seek the UN help in resolving various disputes with India\nand the problems of partition. It accepted the UN-mediated peace and the LOC (Line\nof Control) after the 1948 war on Kashmir. It took the Kashmir issue to the UN Security\nCouncil for its permanent solution in the 1950’s. For example, it condemned the\noccupation of Indonesia by Holland. The World Bank persuaded Pakistan and India\nto accept the Indus Water Treaty in 1960. It also acted as the spokesperson for many\nAsian countries that were struggling for independence in the 1950’s. It also raised the\nPalestine issue on the UN platform and defended the Palestine cause. The UN also\nheld Pakistan and India agree on peace in the Tashkent Accord, 1966. It sent its\ntroops to help the UN peacekeeping forces in many countries including Somalia and\nBosnia-Herzegovina. Many UN organizations helped Pakistan in health, education\nand population planning projects. They include, the WHO (World Health\nOrganization), the UNESCO (UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization)\nand the UNICEF (UN International Children Emergency Fund). The WFP (World Food\nProgram) and the UNHCR (UN High Commission for Refugees) helped Pakistan in\nits economic development and the accommodation of the Afghan refugees.\nUnfortunately, the UN could not resolve the Kashmir issue mainly due to the veto\npower of the five permanent members of the UNSC. Z.A.Bhutto was disappointed by\nthe UN role in the 1971 war as it asked Pakistan to stop fighting instead of accepting\nthe justice of Pakistan’s case. He, therefore, tore apart the UN resolution. He was\nunhappy on the quick recognition of Bangladesh.\nPakistan joined the US-sponsored anti-communist military blocs of SEATO and\nCENTO in 1954-55 alongwith Great Britain and the Muslim states of Iraq and Turkey.\nThis gave a sense of protection to Pakistan and improved its relations with the\nmember states. However, Egypt was unhappy on Pakistan joining these bodies as\nthe British had attacked the Suez Canal in 1956. Moreover, these blocs refused to\nhelp Pakistan in the wars of 1965 and 1971 as the aid was linked with the attack of\nany communist state on Pakistan. Pakistan left SEATO in 1972.\nPakistan became a member of the Commonwealth after independence. It is a club of\nGreat Britain and its former colonies. Several development projects were funded by\nthe Commonwealth, and Pakistan actively participated the Commonwealth Games.\nHowever, the membership depended on the civil/democratic rule in Pakistan.\nPakistan left the Commonwealth in 1972 when Great Britain recognized Bangladesh.\nPakistan could not rejoin it in the 1980’s due to Zia’s military rule. However, it was\nable to join it in 1989 after Benazir Bhutto’s civilian rule began.\nPakistan, Iran and Turkey founded the RCD (Regional Cooperation for Development)\nin 1964. Several agreements were signed to promote trade and cultural ties between\nthe member states. The RCD Highway and the RCD Railways were started to\nfacilitate journey between the three states. After the Iranian Revolution of 1980, the\nRCD gradually became insignificant but after some years it was reorganized as the\nECO (Economic Cooperation Organization) by adding the Central Asian states and\nAfghanistan. However, Pakistan was not very successful in making the ECO a very\neffective bloc mainly because of the disturbed relations between Pakistan and\nAfghanistan.\n\n\nThe OIC (Organization of Islamic Conference/Countries) was founded after a failed\nattempt by a lunatic Jew to burn the al-Aqsa Mosque in 1969. Pakistan became its\nvery active member and, Z.A.Bhutto organized its second summit in Lahore in\nFebruary 1974. Several agreements were signed and resolutions in favour of the\nPalestine cause were adopted. In the 1980’s, Pakistan struggled for an end of the\nIran-Iraq war through the platform of the OIC. Generally, however, Pakistan could not\nmobilize the member states to work for the collective welfare of the Muslim world\nbecause of the rivalry between various states.\nWith the efforts of Pakistan and Bangladesh, the SAARC (South Asian Association\nfor Regional Cooperation) was founded in December 1985. Its aim was to promote\nfriendly relations between the seven countries of South Asia, specially Pakistan, India\nand Bangladesh. SAARC cultural exchange programs and the SAF Games have\nbeen its main features, but due to the Indo-Pak rivalry and the grievances of\nBangladesh against Pakistan have been the major stumbling blocks in making it a\nsuccessful body.\nTo conclude, Pakistan has been very successful as member of various world\norganizations by supporting the UN objective of maintaining world peace and playing\na sincere role in making attempts to resolve various regional and global conflicts. It\nhas been recognized as an important Asian country that wants friendly relations with\nother states.",

The conflict was, however, fully\nresolved years after his death in 1960.\nIn order to resolve the conflict of the three princely states of Hyderabad, Junagadh\nand Jammu and Kashmir he could not get any success as India occupied the first two states\nby force and imposed a war on Pakistan for Kashmir in April 1948. Thus Jinnah’s dream of\npeaceful relations with India was shattered. To conclude it may be said that Jinnah was quite\nsuccessful in overcoming most of the early problems because, against all odds and wishes\nof India, Pakistan not only survived but also began to make progress in various sectors of\neconomy and became an important country in the regional and global politics.\nQ. How successful was the Government of Pakistan in solving the problems\nof partition?\n[14]\nOr\nHow successful was Jinnah in developing the newly created state of\nPakistan?\n[14]\nAns.\nJinnah faced many serious challenges to run the newly created state of Pakistan.\nAfter the 3rd June 1947 Plan, the ML had a little over two months to make preparations for\nhandling the largest Muslim state in the world. In order to frame a constitution, he established\nthe Constituent Assembly on 10 August 1947, under his Chaimanship. He addressed the\nAssembly on 11 August, and urged the need of making a constitution for Pakistan. The 1935\nAct was adopted as the interim constitution with some amendments. He declared Karachi as\nthe Capital of Pakistan. There he set up the first Civil Secretariat, and urged the civil servants\nto dedicate their lives to the service of the nation. He inaugurated the headquarters of three\narmed forces, and negotiated with India for the release of military and financial assets for the\ndefence of Pakistan. An ordinance factory, the POF, was set up in Wah. In order to highlight\nPakistan’s peaceful aims, Pakistan joined the UNO in September 1947. Jinnah wanted\npeaceful relations with India just like the US-Canada relations.\nHowever, it is to be noted that Jinnah retained the executive powers which, according\nto the parliamentary form of government, should have been relegated to the PM. He used to\nchair the cabinet meetings, and take important decisions himself. This was used as a wrong\nprecedent by the future Governor Generals. The process of constitution making was lingered\non even after his death as he had to induct some non-political figures in the cabinet due to a\nshortage of genuine politicians. His dream of good relations with India was also shattered\nand both countries had their first war in 1948. However, due to his failing health, other\nproblems of partition created by India, and a lack of sincere and experienced constitutional\nexperts, there was no progress on constitution making.\nJinnah inaugurated the State Bank of Pakistan in July 1948 so that Pakistan\nintroduced its own currency. The Government of Pakistan presented its first budget in 1948-\n49. It was a balanced budget which indicated Pakistan’s stable economic conditions. He also\nannounced the First Industrial Policy of Pakistan. However, despite his best efforts, there was\nno major industrial development till the 1960’s. India gave 700 million rupees to Pakistan but\nthe remaining 50 million were never paid.\n\n\nThe Quaid was opposed to religious intolerance, provincialism and racialism. He\nadvised the people to think, feel and act as Pakistanis and be proud of it. He toured all the\nareas of Pakistan to spread the message of Pakistani nationalism. In order to safeguard the\nrights of the minorities, and project Pakistan as a tolerant state he adopted the symbolic title\nof the ‘Protector-General’ of religious minorities. His advice was often sought by the non-\nMuslims, and he inducted a Hindu minister in the cabinet. He emphasized the Islamic ideas\nabout justice and equality demanded that any non-Muslims who chose to remain in Pakistan\nshould be treated fairly. Jinnah could do little about the geographical distance of 1,000 miles\nbetween East and West Pakistan. This geographical distance would gradually become a\npolitical gulf that would lead to the separation of East Pakistan in 1971.\nTo help the newly arrived refugees he set up a Relief Fund to rehabilitate them as\nquickly as possible, and temporarily shifted his headquarter to Lahore to personally supervise\nthe process of their accommodation. Unfortunately, millions of refugees would continue to\nsuffer after his death because of shortage of the required resources. All of them could not get\nmedical care, jobs and accommodation. He also negotiated with the Indian government for\nthe Canal Water dispute, and persuaded it not to stop the water altogether. The conflict was,\nhowever, fully resolved years after his death in 1960.\nJinnah wanted to resolve the issue of the three princely states of Hyderabad,\nJunagadh and Jammu and Kashmir but could not get any success as India occupied the first\ntwo states by force and imposed a war on Pakistan for Kashmir in April ..."
